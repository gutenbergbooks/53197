<h2><a name="i" id="i"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Shipboard</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">ALWAYS TRUST YOUR LUCK</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It must</span> be fun to be an artist.” Stasia’s
speech was somewhat impeded by the mouthful
of pins she was trying not to swallow.</p>

<p>“Fun?” Cynthia frowned, thinking. “Yes,
I suppose it is. I wouldn’t know how to be anything
else. Ouch! That was me you were pinning.”
She braced herself with one arm against
the bulkhead as the ship tipped at a slight angle.
“Make that sleeve as short as you can.”</p>

<p>Stasia took the last pin out of her mouth.
“Slip off your blouse now, and I’ll baste it up for
you. You’ll make a sweet pirate, if pirates ever
were sweet.”</p>

<p>Cynthia, free of the blouse, turned to experiment
before the long mirror in the door, hesitating
between the respective merits of a red bandana
handkerchief over her black curls and the
more sinister effect of a black scarf which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
be continued down into a black mask with eyeholes.</p>

<p>Stasia bit off her thread. “There, that’s
ready. When will you break it to Miss Mitchall
that she’s got to wear a costume tonight?”</p>

<p>Cynthia giggled. “You ought to come along
and help me. But I guess I’ll wait till the last
minute and rush her into the idea.” She glanced
toward the bed where a tall, witch’s cap, made
of green cardboard from the ship’s barber shop,
reposed beside a cape of green broadcloth, borrowed
from Stasia, and a pair of Miss Mitchall’s
own shoes, now adorned with huge buckles of
cardboard and silver foil.</p>

<p>“I’ll need some help with my wig,” said
Stasia, “and then I think we’re all finished.”
The wig was of bright orange yarn, loosely
knitted into a tight fitting cap of coarse net
which completely covered Stasia’s sleek bob.</p>

<p>“It needs tightening at the back. Wait a
moment.” Cynthia braced her feet. “Dash
this boat, I hope she stops rolling before dinner
or we shan’t have any dance. Do they always
have a costume party every trip?”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Always the second day before we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
get into Cherbourg, Paris, day after tomorrow.
Aren’t you thrilled?”</p>

<p>Cynthia, pinning the wig into a better fit,
murmured a vague assent. But she didn’t feel
at all thrilled. After eight days the ship was
like another home in which she knew, by sight
at least, almost every occupant. Paris was going
to be new and strange. Oh yes, a grand new
adventure, but sometimes she got scared at the
thought of it. So big, with all the street signs
and the menus in a different language and so
much that was new to learn. What if she failed
to make good on the job that had brought her
over, the dozen covers for <cite>Little Ones’ Magazine</cite>?
Suppose she didn’t have the money to
stay? Suppose she couldn’t make people understand
her French, even though Stasia had been
coaching her all week? Oh shut up, Cynthia!</p>

<p>“Miss Mitchall’s the old girl I admire,” she
said suddenly. “She’s got more courage! You
know she’s returning practically without a job
and without money and she’s fifty if she’s a day,
though she looks sixty, poor darling. I don’t
believe she’s got ten dollars beyond her fare to
London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“What was she doing in the States?” asked
Stasia.</p>

<p>Stasia hadn’t, Cynthia thought, much imagination,
but perhaps that was because her father
was president of the line. Look at this suite de
luxe, the best in the ship. And if she had never
earned her own living she couldn’t imagine what
it was to be like Miss Mitchall.</p>

<p>“Oh, she had some sort of a governess job.
But she’s English you know, and she didn’t come
in on the quota and so she had to go back home.
She was with a Canadian family in Buffalo.
They are paying her fare back, but that’s all. I
wish ...” she stopped. She was going to say
she wished she could help her.</p>

<p>Stasia looked at her watch, the little platinum
watch circled with diamonds. “It’s six my dear,
and dinner’s at half past seven. If you’re going
to get your roommate into her costume ...”</p>

<p>“You’re right, you’re perfectly right.” Cynthia
struggled into her wool dress, grabbed the
black scarf, the buckled shoes, threw the blouse
over her arm. “Here, give me a hand with the
other stuff, will you? I’ll take the hat.”</p>

<p>Cynthia’s small cabin was down, down, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
steep flights below the cabins de luxe. Clean
white corridors smelling of soap and sea and
ship, doors shut and white, doors open and dark,
doors open and lighted, a narrow corridor turning
down to the left, two doors facing each
other, the left one always closed. Cynthia often
wondered about that door. She knew the cabin
was occupied because the room steward went in
and out but no one else ever did. The door to
the right was Cynthia’s and Miss Mitchall’s.</p>

<p>“Here we are. Thanks a lot. Can I help with
make-up or anything?” Cynthia dumped her
things on the bunk, turned on the lights.</p>

<p>“No, thanks. The stewardess and Lilia will
help if I want it.” Lilia was Stasia’s maid.
Cynthia smiled. Think of having a maid to
yourself!</p>

<p>Stasia was gone. Cynthia hustled out of her
dress again, turned on the hot water, whistled
happily. This was going to be fun tonight.
Like the old Art Academy days when everybody
dressed up and the dances lasted till morning.</p>

<p>Someone in the cabin across the corridor
coughed, a man’s cough. Cynthia turned off
the hot water and listened, caught herself staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
with wide gray eyes at the wide gray eyes
in the mirror over the wash basin.</p>

<p>The night she had come on board that left
hand door had been wide open and in the corridor
there had been a suitcase, big and black, with
lots of stickers on it. Cynthia hurrying along
the hall with an arm full of last minute fruit
and flowers and books, Chick and Judy and the
others of the old Art School bunch at her heels,
had <a name="tripped" id="tripped"></a><ins title="Original has 'tipped'">tripped</ins> and fallen full length over that suitcase.
When Chick had picked her up, unhurt,
and brushed her off, she had noted the suitcase
and a huge Ottawa Hotel paster on its side,
bright with greens and blues and oranges. Chick
had noticed it too. “A good poster design, that,”
he had said.</p>

<p>And Cynthia, thinking about Chick, sat down
on the lower bunk and for three minutes was
devastatingly and overwhelmingly homesick for
New York and the studio, for Judy and Chick.
Chick had, in this very room, standing on that
very same rug, kissed her good-bye with his arms
tight around her and wished her good luck and
told her how rotten it was for him to have to
stay behind like this. “Keep my ring on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
finger and my face in your heart,” he had said.</p>

<p>Cynthia twisted the pretty emerald, which
had belonged to Chick’s mother, now so ill that
he couldn’t get away for the trip they had
planned together. It was a sweet ring. Cynthia’s
eyes were getting teary when the dressing
gong sounded. Goodness, was it as late as that!</p>

<p>The pirate costume had long black trousers&mdash;full
ones from Cynthia’s beach pyjamas. A
wide sash of twisted red and green bristled with
an arsenal of silver paper pistols and knives.
The white blouse, with sleeves tacked very short,
bore a black silk skull and crossbones over
the heart. She was tying heavy thread on brass
curtain rings to loop over her ears when Miss
Mitchall pattered in, closing the door gently
behind her.</p>

<p>Miss Mitchall’s small sloping shoulders,
claw-like hands and thin blond hair, now a dusty
gray, were the characteristics of the story-book
English governess, but her eyes gleamed
brightly behind her spectacles and one felt that
her spirit was unconquerable.</p>

<p>“Oh my dear, how sweet you look,” she twittered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Cynthia hung an earring over one ear and
patted it with a slim finger to see if it would
swing free. In a minute she’d have to break the
news to her roommate. But Miss Mitchall had
news of her own.</p>

<p>“I just heard a voice across the corridor, talking
to the steward. It’s a man and he talks with
a Canadian accent,” she whispered.</p>

<p>They had both wondered about that room,
for on this small ship everyone seemed to know
everyone else, with that exception. Was he ill,
perhaps, that he never came out, not even for
meals? But there wasn’t time to discuss him
now.</p>

<p>“Hurry and get into your costume for the
party,” directed Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Costume? Oh yes.” Miss Mitchall was
going to appreciate the small jest. “You mean
my black dress.” She turned, bustling a little,
to put her purse and book and scarf and sweater
on the long couch beneath the porthole.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean just the black dress,”
stated Cynthia in what she hoped was a firm
tone. “I mean your costume. Stasia Carruthers
and I made one for you this afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
You’re going as a Green Witch. See here.”
She took down the tall peaked hat, clapped it on
the small gray head and turned her roommate
to face the mirror. “Then the cape, like this.”
She flung the long cape around the thin shoulders.
“Of course we must make you up. A little
powder on your nose, probably some rouge on
your cheeks. But put on your black dress first.
And hurry.”</p>

<p>“Oh my dear, I couldn’t&mdash;I’m too old&mdash;what
will people think?” Mildly clucking, continuing
to protest, Miss Mitchall was shoved
into her costume, into the shoes with the silver
buckles, into the long green cape. Cynthia,
against the other’s mild opposition, patted rouge
on the pale cheeks, then flung a towel over the
cape and shook half a box of white talcum powder
on the gray hair.</p>

<p>“But my dear,” beamed Miss Mitchall, “it
... it makes me look so ... so young.”</p>

<p>Indeed it did. The contrast of green cloth
against the white hair was dramatic. “Very successful,”
purred Cynthia. “You’ll be the belle
of the ball. And it’s not immoral to look young
you know. Now sit down there and be good till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
I get this scarf tied. Or no, ring for the steward,
we must get a broom to go with the witch.”</p>

<p>By the time they hurried out of their cabin
the echoes of the dinner gong had been dead for
ten minutes. But the corridors were full of
laughing groups: harlequins, monks, pierrots,
Turkish ladies, Dutch girls and nondescript
costumes that defied a label. For fear that the
Green Witch might bolt back to the cabin,
Cynthia kept close behind her but after a few
minutes realized this was unnecessary. Their
passage was a minor triumphal procession for
everyone turned to look at them and made some
delighted exclamation over the novel costumes.
Cynthia was amused to note that Miss Mitchall’s
sharp little chin went higher, her step
became firmer as the approbation grew and by
the time they reached the stairway to the dining
saloon she walked like a princess approaching
her throne.</p>

<p>Cheers and a spatter of applause greeted
their descent and three tables claimed their company
but Cynthia looked around and made a
quick decision. In a far corner sat Harvey
O’Neill, as the Tin Woodman, and Johnnie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Graham, in sackcloth and straw, presumably a
scarecrow. Miss Mitchall needed what only
an Irish tongue could supply. Cynthia steered
toward the small table.</p>

<p>“May I introduce the Green Witch of Greenwich
Village?” sang Cynthia above the hubbub.
“Did you know that Green Witches had special
magic and charms, much stronger than black
and white ones?”</p>

<p>“Special charms, certainly,” agreed the Irishman.
“Come and cast a spell on me, Miss
Witch,” and he pulled out a chair for her. Cynthia
took the one next to Johnnie.</p>

<p>“Smart of you,” he whispered in her ear,
“to give her a costume that went with her specs.
It’s one of the best on the floor.”</p>

<p>There was an almost continual pageant down
the wide stairs. Stasia made her entrance alone
and effectively in the long, slinky costume of a
modern French doll. From the bright orange
wig of knitted yarn, through the high bodice and
long full skirt of brilliant reds and raw blues
to the absurdly high heeled slippers of green
satin and the painted circles on her cheeks beneath
the wide lashed baby stare, she was perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
in every detail. Even to a price tag on her
shoulder stating “twenty five francs.” She was
followed by a Spanish señorita on the arm of a
George Belchers, charlady, red nosed, apron-garbed,
three dingy violets nodding in his bonnet
as he stumbled apologetically, paused to mop up
the steps before the <a name="senorita" id="senorita"></a><ins title="Original has 'senorita'">señorita</ins> and dramatized the
amusing entrance.</p>

<p>How she hated to have this end, Cynthia
thought. Paris, surely, wasn’t going to be half
so much fun. And never to see any of these
nice people again. ... Miss Mitchall for instance.
It didn’t seem possible that you could
get to know a person so well and then let them
slip out of your life. Stasia was going to stay in
Cherbourg for a week. Johnnie ...</p>

<p>“Where do you go, Johnnie?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Straight through Paris and down to Provence.
I’m studying the poetry of Mistral,
who, if you don’t happen to know, was the greatest
poet of southern France. Why?”</p>

<p>But she turned to O’Neill. “And you’re going
to Ireland, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Better come along,” he suggested, “it’s
a bit of heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
“Oh yes, there’s a song about that, isn’t
there,” she laughed. Weren’t any of these
people going to be in Paris? Suppose she
couldn’t get in touch with the editor she had
come to see? Suppose the job didn’t materialize?
Suppose ... well, these were nice cheerful
meditations to have in the middle of a party!
She bet Miss Mitchall wasn’t harboring any
such gloomy thoughts. Suddenly Cynthia
wished there was some way, some nice, tactful,
subtle manner in which she could help the little
governess without her knowing it. But a loan
was out of the question. Cynthia herself hadn’t
much more than the price of a ticket home.
And you don’t pick up purses in mid ocean.</p>

<p>“I wish there was a Duchess on board, with a
million pounds sterling and eighteen children,
and that she would fall overboard and I could
save her life,” was her fantastic thought. She
must have said it out loud for Johnnie murmured,
“Heaven help us!” and then glanced
at the little governess. “Oh, you mean for Miss
Mitchall. But why stop at eighteen when you’re
wishing!”</p>

<p>Cynthia spluttered into giggles and felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
better. In fact she could scarcely eat her dinner
for all that was going on around her. Bright
balloons bumped her elbow, a rain of multicolored
confetti sprinkled the table cloth and
brilliant streamers of paper flying through the
air, must be picked up and returned, lacing the
dining saloon with carnival colors.</p>

<p>After dinner there was a dance in the lounge.
Cynthia had looked forward to it all day and the
day before, but after a few waltzes and foxtrots
it began, somehow, to fall flat. Everyone else
seemed to be having a perfectly gorgeous time.
Even little Miss Mitchall was plentifully supplied
with partners but their enjoyment seemed
only to increase Cynthia’s gloom as every step
she made took <a name="her" id="her"></a><ins title="Original has here">her</ins> nearer to the time of leaving
the ship, to the dreaded unknown.</p>

<p>She knew what it was. She had done too little
work for days. This wasn’t the first time that
idleness had made her miserable, and it would
be useless to explain this to her puzzled partners.
Between dances she would slip off and dive below
for her sketch pad. Drawing would bring
the relief it always had brought and as for
models, they were all about her. All she needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
was her book to make a record, not just of the
clever costumes around her, but of the movement
and the groups that the dancers made.
Why not get it? Left, for the moment, between
dances without a partner, Cynthia decided that
she would, and sped down to the cabin.</p>

<p>As she came along the main corridor, deserted
now since all of the room stewards were at their
dinner, she heard a door banging, banging, with
the slow swing of the ship and irritatedly wondered
why no one had fastened it.</p>

<p>Turning down the small corridor that led to
her own cabin she noted that the swinging door
was that opposite her own. If someone were ill
in there, the door must be extremely annoying.
She opened her own door, switched on the cabin
light, found her sketch book and stepped out
again. Again the door opposite slammed back.
The cabin light was on. She tapped gently on
the doorframe. Perhaps the occupant was too
ill to get up. But no one answered.</p>

<p>Cynthia put her hand on the knob to close
it, but the door was partly wedged by a suitcase
which had slid against it&mdash;the suitcase which
she recognized as the same she had tripped over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
when she first came on board. Or was it the
same? There was that Mexican Airways label,
and next to it a circular yellow paster which
formed a pattern her mind had already recorded,
but something was missing. She closed the door
gently, shoved it to see that it was firmly latched,
and hurried along the corridor. But as she ran
up the stairway she remembered what was missing.
The Ottawa label had been sponged off.
There was a darker spot on the leather where it
had been.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the lounge, the color and
light and music burst on her like a shower of
thrown confetti. Figures whirled and swayed
to the music, the room was a shifting patchwork
of bright color. Even Miss Mitchall had been
persuaded to dance and jigged round and round
happily with a little Hungarian whose bent
knees and extreme speed were relics of an older
era.</p>

<p>Cynthia passed behind the row of chairs at
the end of the dance floor and skirted the room
to where, in a remote corner behind an empty
card table, she could be comfortably inconspicuous
yet have a good view of the dancers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
She leafed through her sketch book, found some
blank pages and began to work.</p>

<p>Between encores the couples paused, chatted,
and applauded. That scarecrow with his
whitened face and clay pipe ... Cynthia got it
with a few strokes of the pencil. Then Miss Mitchall’s
rapt expression as she gazed into her
partner’s face, radiant, unconscious. Oh darn!
The music had started again.</p>

<p>Cynthia made a dozen rapid action sketches
of the dancing couples (some of them so close
to caricatures she wouldn’t have cared to have
the models see them), yawned, and looked about
her. Perhaps it would be more fun to go back
to dancing.</p>

<p>Most of the older people had drifted away
and were talking at the further end of the room,
or had gone in to the card tables. How different
some of them looked in costume. She would
scarcely have recognized Mrs. Moody, for instance,
in the white hair and patches of a colonial
belle. And the man with her ... Cynthia
frowned, trying to place him. Oh yes, it was
the hat that had put her off. He was the man in
the golf cap who tramped the deck all day long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
... “walking to Europe,” Johnnie Graham had
said. But the middle aged man who sat alone,
not far from Cynthia? Surely she had never
seen him before, surely she would have remembered
that beak-like nose, the hollow cut deeply
on either side of it and the thin lipped mouth.</p>

<p>She made a few strokes of her pencil on the
blank page of her sketch book, then, noting how
still her unconscious model sat, became absorbed
in the portrait. Not a good face, but a strong
one. The brows were as heavy as her pencil
could etch, the graying hair at the temples disappeared
beneath the tightly drawn edge of a
stocking cap and the long chin dipped into a
wide pierrot ruff. The costume was that of a
harlequin and had probably been rented from
the ship’s barber, who carried a stock of fancy
costumes for these parties.</p>

<p>Cynthia, absorbed in her sketch, worked
rapidly. The claw-like hand that had reached
up to pull away the ruff ... the long white scar
just showing at the side of the chin, not an old
scar, she thought, for it still showed pink at the
edges. Her model sat quietly, unaware of the
attention he was receiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
No, that chin wasn’t right. Cynthia flipped
over another page and made a more detailed
study of the lower part of the face. This was
a type she could use, sometime, in an illustration.
She wondered vaguely what the man did when
he wasn’t on ship board. Then the music stopped.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that his attention had wandered
from the dancers or perhaps it was a sudden
sense of being watched, but the man turned
quickly in his seat and sent such a glare of enmity
at the astonished Cynthia that she started and
dropped her book. When she emerged from
groping beneath the table her model had disappeared.
He must have moved very quickly
for he was already slipping through the door.
Cynthia shook herself. That man certainly
didn’t like artists! But this was a good waltz,
why not enjoy it.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when she tiptoed into
the cabin. Miss Mitchall was already asleep.
Her tall green hat and the long cape were neatly
disposed on the couch beneath the window. She
was still asleep when Cynthia dressed silently
next morning, when she left for breakfast. The
dining saloon was almost deserted. Nearly everyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
seemed to be sleeping late or breakfasting in
bed.</p>

<p>“My last day on shipboard,” thought Cynthia
a little mournfully. What to do to stretch it out
to its full length? She decided to spend the
morning on deck, sketching; the afternoon in
the lounge with a book, or perhaps a game of
deck tennis with Stasia. But in the middle of
the morning a thunder shower drove everyone
indoors and Cynthia found Stasia and her father
over coffee and toast in the lounge.</p>

<p>“This is Dad’s second breakfast and my first,”
announced Stasia. “Have some coffee, Cynthia?”</p>

<p>Cynthia declined the coffee. “I was up with
the larks, or at least the seagulls,” she said. “Do
you mind if I sketch you while you eat? I’ve
wanted to get you all week.” But what she
really wanted was Mr. Carruthers with his
rugged beak of a nose, his thin, slightly curling
mouth. In fact she became so intent on her
sketch that she forgot she was supposed to be
drawing Stasia till the tall girl laughed:</p>

<p>“Dad, she’s found you more beautiful than I
am!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
“What, what? That so?” Mr. Carruthers
had been the ideal model, absolutely unconscious
of Cynthia’s flying pencil. It seemed only fair,
however, to show him the drawing when it was
finished.</p>

<p>“And this is my roommate. Look, Stasia, I
got her last night when she was dancing with the
Hungarian.”</p>

<p>Stasia murmured, “wish I could draw like
that.” Mr. Carruthers, too, seemed impressed.
“Good work, young lady,” he nodded. But
Cynthia felt he wouldn’t have much use for
artists. He would have all the conventional
ideas about them; temperament and talk and
starving in garrets.</p>

<p>Stasia was turning the leaves slowly, making
here and there a comment, Mr. Carruthers looking
over her shoulder till he stopped her with a
large forefinger suddenly on one page.</p>

<p>“Who is this? Where did you sketch him?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Cynthia leaned across the table. “Oh, that
man? Isn’t it a wicked face? I wish you could
have seen ...”</p>

<p>But Mr. Carruthers was impatient. He took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the book from Stasia. “Tell me about this.
When did you sketch this? Last night? And
what was this, part of the costume? Make-up?”</p>

<p>“No,” Cynthia laughed, “it was a bad scar,
a fairly new one for it was still pink and raw-looking.
I think he had tried to cover it with
that harlequin ruff, but when he grew warm he
forgot about it, and pushed the ruff away from
his face.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers had already pushed the little
electric bell with an insistent finger. Before
the hurrying steward had reached the table, Mr.
Carruthers barked, “Ask Captain Wain if we
can see him immediately, in his office, and tell
the purser to join us there.” Then he turned to
Cynthia, “I’d like you to come along and tell
the Captain what you just told me. And may
we borrow your sketch book for an hour or two?”</p>

<p>Puzzled and excited, Cynthia followed Stasia
and her father out of the lounge, down the corridor
towards the captain’s office. Captain
Wain was a plump little man with a ruddy complexion
that had weathered many storms, white
walrus whiskers, and a blue uniform with lots of
glittering buttons. Behind him stood the purser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
whom Cynthia already knew, a lean, hatchet-faced
man, with small sharp eyes and an <a name="apologetic" id="apologetic"></a><ins title="Original has 'opologetic'">apologetic</ins>
manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers held the door for the two
girls, then closed it firmly behind him and
plunged immediately into his subject.</p>

<p>“It’s this matter of Goncourt,” he stated, and
opened Cynthia’s sketchbook where his thumb
had been keeping the place. “I want you two to
see this.”</p>

<p>The Captain leaned to look at the portrait
of the man in the ruff, and passed it to the purser
with no comment save a brief “Mmumph!”</p>

<p>The purser examined it somewhat longer.
“Miss Wanstead made this?” he asked.</p>

<p>Cynthia, bewildered, explained when and
where she had made the sketch, and questioned
further, explained about the scar.</p>

<p>“He really had such a scar? It wasn’t grease
paint, or whatever it is you use on your face?”</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head. You didn’t put
things like that in a sketch when you were making
notes from real life. It was, she told them,
exactly as she had drawn it. She didn’t have
any reason to make it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. Carruthers sat down and waved the
others to chairs. “Might we,” he suggested,
“see Goncourt’s passport again?”</p>

<p>Yes, the purser would bring it. He seemed
glad to get away. Stasia, who had quietly
watched all this now said, “Don’t you think it
would be a good plan, Dad, if we told Cynthia
what this was all about?” And, at her father’s
nod of assent, explained: “Dad is owner of this
steamship line, you see, and the night we sailed
from New York the head of the Police Department
came down to see us off. He had come,
he said, especially to get track of a man with a
scar on his face. It was then late in the evening,
you see, and most of the passengers were on
board, but the purser examined all passports for
a man with a scar like that. It was said to be very
conspicuous, and the men at the gate watched all
other passengers who came in after that, but
they decided that no such man was on board.”</p>

<p>“He’s wanted by the police?” asked Cynthia,
feeling very much like a murder-mystery tale.</p>

<p>“Yes, for smuggling ... in ...”</p>

<p>“Here is the passport.” The purser, returning,
had a little blue book, not a dark red one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
such as Cynthia’s, in his hand. He passed the
book to the Captain who gave it a brief glance,
grunted non-committally and shoved it towards
Mr. Carruthers. Stasia’s father compared the
photograph to the face in Cynthia’s sketch book,
but as one was full face, the other in profile,
little could be gained by the comparison.</p>

<p>“Is this the man?” he asked Cynthia, indicating
the passport photograph.</p>

<p>Cynthia got up and came around the desk.
Passport in hand she moved to the window for a
better light. As she examined the picture she
was aware of the silent tenseness behind her and
suddenly had an idea of how important all this
was, important to several people. Closing her
eyes, she tried to remember more fully the face
she had sketched, not from the side as she had
drawn him, but as he had quickly turned to gaze
at her, full face, under the dark frowning brows.
Then she looked again at the picture in her hand.
It was very like. Still ...</p>

<p>“No, it’s not the same man.”</p>

<p>There was a little stir in the room and Mr.
Carruthers got up and came to stand beside her.</p>

<p>“But it’s very like him.” Something teased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
at her brain. Like and not like ... like and not
like ...</p>

<p>“It might be a relation,” she hazarded dubiously.
“This man,” she tapped the passport,
“has had a broken nose at some time. We had a
model with one at the Academy, so I recognized
the peculiar shape.” It was not at all like the
beaky feature she had sketched.</p>

<p>Absently she gazed at the cover of the passport.
“What cabin is this man in? The one
with the passport.”</p>

<p>“He’s in 376, Miss,” the purser answered.</p>

<p>And Cynthia was in 374, right across the little
corridor. The passport in her hand was Canadian,
and Miss Mitchall had said ... “Look
here,” Cynthia said suddenly, “could my roommate
be called? I think she might be able to
help us;” and added, “you can be sure she won’t
talk.”</p>

<p>The captain glanced dubiously at Stasia’s
father. “The less people who know about this ...”
then, at the other’s nodded gesture toward
the purser, “ask her to come here,” he commanded
gruffly.</p>

<p>Miss Mitchall, slightly fluttering, was produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
almost immediately. Cynthia didn’t try
to explain the circumstances, just showed her
the passport. “Did you ever see this man? I
mean, does he look familiar?”</p>

<p>Squinting near-sightedly, the little governess
examined the picture, then passed it back with
a shake of her head. “No, my dear. I’ve never
seen him.”</p>

<p>There was a sigh in the cabin. But Cynthia
had not finished. That teasing idea of hers ...
Miss Mitchall had once told her something
that bore on this. ... “Then if not that man,
someone very like him?”</p>

<p>“Someone like him, surely. But not that man.
Probably a twin brother. I was a twin myself.”</p>

<p>So that was it. Cynthia’s memory had almost,
but not quite, done the trick.</p>

<p>“By Gad!” barked the Captain, “the woman
has brains! Where did you see this man, madame?”
His tone was weighty with respect.</p>

<p>“In the cabin across from 374. Once the
door was open as I passed and he was shaving,
with the light full on his face. There was
quite a scar on his cheek. He shut the door
with a slam when he saw me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Cynthia was still looking at the passport in
her hand. “Was this man from Ottawa, the
one you wanted?” she asked. Then gasped.</p>

<p>It was almost as though she had sprung a
mine, so laughably surprised were the faces
about her. “How did you know that?” the Captain’s
gruff tones held suspicion.</p>

<p>But Cynthia had suddenly remembered the
suitcase she had stumbled over the first day, and
the dark patch that showed some label had been
removed from it. “You see,” she explained
further, “I’m accustomed to remembering the
shapes and colors of things, perhaps more than
most people do because that’s part of my job.
I remembered an Ottawa paster on the suitcase
because of a certain clever arrangement of
colors, green and blue and orange.”</p>

<p>Mr. Carruthers stopped her with a gesture.
Stepping into the doorway he spoke a moment
in a low voice to the steward outside then returned
to the room. “Will you describe this
label for us, or could you draw it?”</p>

<p>“It’s something like this.” Cynthia took the
pencil out of her pocket and made a little diagram
on a blank page of her note book. “It had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
an orange moon and a tower, rather medieval,
dark blue against it. Then there was a jiggley
border of green, in this manner.”</p>

<p>The steward with something in his hand,
stood in the doorway. Mr. Carruthers rose and
brought in a suitcase, not the black one, but a
small, light-tan airplane case. He turned it
around so that all might see the Ottawa label,
exactly as Cynthia had sketched it.</p>

<p>“We were in Ottawa a few weeks ago,” he explained,
“and I remembered this label on our
bag. You see,” he turned to Cynthia, “this man
is wanted in Canada for jewel stealing. The
police of Ottawa had wired the police of New
York to watch for him on any boat leaving port
within the next few days. I believe he has
sailed on this line before, but we have to be
awfully sure before we can make an arrest. The
publicity, if the man were innocent, would be
unpleasant for the steamship company.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and make the arrest myself.” The
Captain departed, taking the purser with him.</p>

<p>Stasia, who had been quiet as a mouse all this
time, prodded her father with a finger. “Daddy,
tell Cynthia the rest of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
“Oh yes ... ah,” Mr. Carruthers cleared
his throat. “A hum ... we are extremely
grateful to you ladies, Miss Wanstead, and Miss
Mitchall. It would have been awkward if he
had escaped by our line. Of course you understand
that there is a reward for information
leading to his arrest. And I think we can say
that the reward will be yours if this is Goncourt,
as we now fully believe.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And to think that it really was Goncourt and
that he has been in that cabin all the week,”
thrilled Miss Mitchall for the hundredth time.</p>

<p>Cynthia grinned. “And to think of your
suggesting the twin business, of your knowing
it was a Canadian accent. That was really as
important as the sketch. You see he got the scar
in Ottawa, when he made a big haul of some
jewels, about a year ago, and then he went to
Quebec and did the same thing. But then he
used the picture of a twin brother on his passport
and covered the scar with a muffler when he
came on board. I suppose he was afraid to go
out of his cabin very much.”</p>

<p>“How like a Wallace novel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Cynthia went on folding things to put into
her suitcase. In another minute she could close
it, not to be opened again until she was in France.
“I wonder,” she asked without turning, “if you
would do me a great favor?”</p>

<p>“Why of course my dear, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see this reward business is rather
a bother.” Cynthia didn’t say that Stasia had
warned her it might be some weeks before the
check got through. “I wonder if you would
take some of my money now, as part of your
share. If I have too much I’m liable to spend it
on Paris hats and foolish things, you see. Perhaps
a hundred now, and when the check comes
I’ll send you the rest of your half.”</p>

<p>For a moment Cynthia was afraid Miss Mitchall
would see through her plan and refuse, but
the little governess smiled and nodded. Yes,
she knew how tempting Paris was if you had
money. Yes, she’d be glad to take some of it
now.</p>

<p>Cynthia snapped off the light and hauled herself
into the upper bunk. Paris tomorrow!
But she wasn’t afraid of her luck any more.
She’d proved it would stand by her.</p>

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Paris</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">CORNED BEEF HASH</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Steamship</span> and steamer friends had been left
behind. Paris was ahead, closer now with every
minute, every hurrying second. The little
French girl who had kept on her hat and gloves
and had read, in silence, a paper covered copy
of Anatole France all the way from Cherbourg,
let down the window, leaned out to wave a beckoning
hand, and shouted, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Porteur! Porteur!</i>”</p>

<p>Cynthia waited patiently, but as the other
seemed in no haste to relinquish her place at the
window, the American finally leaned over the
French girl’s shoulder and beckoned in similar
fashion. The long train slid gently to a stop
and a score of stout little blue smocked men
seemed to spring from the ground and began
taking baggage from the open windows, loading
it on wide straps over their sturdy shoulders.</p>

<p>Cynthia captured the eye of number 972; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
beady eye above a red nose and a moustache that
would have graced a member of the <a name="Beggars" id="Beggars"></a><ins title="Original has 'Begger’s'">Beggar’s</ins>
Opera. She gulped, “Taxi!”&mdash;thank goodness,
there was a word that meant the same in
several languages, at which he grinned cheerfully
and slung her heavy suitcase and her paint
box in one huge paw. The other grasped her
neighbor’s bags and the whole strange and unwieldy
combination lumbered off down the platform.
Was he gone for good? Better follow
that French girl, Cynthia decided. She seemed
unconcerned. Oh, one had to give up the ticket
here, and there was the porter again. No more
customs, that had all been cleared at the quay,
earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>The street met her with a blast of warm July
air, a dazzle of summer sunlight and such a medley
of strange noises: taxis hooting in a new,
high key; shrill-pitched voices, mingled shouts
and confusion, that she stood for a moment bewildered
and lost. Horrid luck that no one
she knew from the boat had been coming to Paris
on this train!</p>

<p>Then Cynthia saw that her bag and paint box
had been piled into a taxi like a shiny black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
beetle and the blue smocked one waited for his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourboire</i>. She tipped him ten francs. Was
that too much, or too little? She had been
warned that, in either case, he would glare, but
this one smiled, muttered, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</i>” and departed.
The hotel address was written on a card
and Cynthia had only to show that to the driver,
hop in, and they were off.</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>“Well, so this is Paris!”</p>

<p>“Well ...,” Cynthia giggled nervously.
To be really here. To have arrived safely, all
by herself. Well, that was something. “Paris!”</p>

<p>She sighed, relaxed back against the cushions
and closed her eyes for a moment. Oh, the taxi
was stopping. Her eyes popped open. Just a
little policeman in a toy soldier cape and a white
stick with which he seemed, miraculously, to
hold up this mad traffic. Off again. She shut
her eyes once more. New smells, hot asphalt,
violets, damp warm air, something cooking,
other things. She just couldn’t keep her eyes
shut.</p>

<p>The car was running along gray cobbles between
gray houses high and incredibly ancient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Tall, plane trees leaned out over gray walls that
held in a silvery stream. The Seine! A little
gay colored steamer, like a miniature ferry-boat,
hooted and put off from a landing. Cynthia
wanted to hug it all at once, to pinch herself
to be sure she was here. How she wished
Judy could see it, and Chick, dear Chick. This
was to have been their honeymoon. He’d be
over shortly, a few weeks at the most. And
meanwhile there was work to be done; a language
to learn, Nancy and Mrs. Brewster to see,
and covers to be done for <cite>Little One’s Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>Was that, could that possibly be, Notre Dame
over there to the left? And the Eiffel Tower
clear ahead, misty against sunny sky? She had
seen it as they came in on the train. Really
Paris!</p>

<p>“Not a motion picture!” chuckled Cynthia.
And tomorrow she could go and see it all for
herself.</p>

<p>Then a second bridge, Place St. Michel. And
a swift turn to the left into a narrow street where
noises echoed back from the high stone houses
to right and left. They drew up before a door
and a boy, in a horizontal striped waistcoat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
white shirt sleeves, came out from the hotel
entrance. Here was her home in Paris.</p>

<p>Inside, at the little brass-railed desk, they
had a key for her room and a letter from Mrs.
Brewster, who had made her reservation for
her. There was a little cage-like elevator into
which one squeezed, barely avoiding the folding
doors, and then up, up, like a wobbly balloon.
A hallway musty and dark, and at last a tall
room with two high French windows opening
on to a small balcony.</p>

<p>“Yes, this will do nicely,” said Cynthia in her
best French, and so moved into Paris.</p>

<p>When the door closed, Cynthia sat down to
catch her breath. So much had happened in the
last half hour, she had seen so much that was
new, and strange, and lovely. “I suppose there
are people that live in Paris all the time and
take it as a matter of course,” she told herself.
“And, I suppose, I shall get to take it that way
too, after a bit. But now it’s all rather frightening.
I wonder if I can make myself understood,
I wonder if I shall get lost, I wonder ...
oh goodness, how shall I order meals? But perhaps
menu French is the same everywhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Mrs. Brewster’s letter was reassuring. She
seemed to think Cynthia would find everything
very simple and easy. “But I am giving you the
address of a little French girl, who speaks excellent
English, she was a governess in London
for some years. If you get lonely, or wish to
improve your accent,” ha, <em>accent!</em> “don’t hesitate
to look her up.” Enclosed was also a note
from Nancy.</p>

<p>“Do come to Conquet,” she begged. “Mother
and I are both painting here. <a name="Its" id="Its"></a><ins title="Original has 'Its'">It’s</ins> all pearly gray
mists and long, empty beaches and sabots, and
fish and steep streets and old houses. And you
can find lots of children to pose for your covers.”</p>

<p>It did sound fun. But Paris seemed quite
enough adventure for the moment. And Cynthia’s
purse was very flat. She must first see
Mr. Culbert, who was over here now, and was
the editor of the magazine for which she had a
contract for a dozen covers, see if she couldn’t
get an advance on the first order, and if he
could put her in touch with a way to get models.
Just at the moment she hadn’t the slightest idea
how to go about getting one for the painting
she must do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
She sat down and wrote to Nancy, planning to
mail the letter when she went out to dinner.
Then leaning out on the little balcony, she
watched the light fade in the street below, listening
to the sounds of Paris echo up between
the ancient, stained, backward sloping housefronts.</p>

<p>What, she wondered, with a little pang of
homesickness, were they doing now at home?
Six o’clock ... but no, time was different.
Was it three over there, or nine, now? The
mental gymnastics made her head reel and she
decided that she was hungry. But plenty of
time yet. Cynthia hated to admit to herself
that she dreaded that first meal alone, doubted
her ability to order food, even to find her way
home again, once she had set her foot off the
hotel doorstep. It was after eight o’clock when
she finally tore herself away from the window
and summoned courage to go out for dinner.
“You can’t starve till morning, idiot!” she told
herself severely. “Just walk downstairs, and
out the door. There must be lots of places to eat
within the next two blocks. Why, France is a
nation of cooks!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
A short way up the Boule’ Miche’, she found
a little place with pretty red-and-white checked
table cloths on the iron topped tables, behind
dusty box hedges in their wooden boxes. This
was pleasantly removed from a small band that
was playing lustily, and not too melodiously, on
the street corner. Funny about those bands. She
had passed three in the short distance from the
hotel and another had begun playing beneath
her window just as she went out.</p>

<p>No one else seemed to be eating. Perhaps
French people dined later than this. The menu
was as much an enigma as she had expected. It
was written in a flowing Spencerian hand, in
dim violet ink on a limp and food-stained bit of
paper. Hardly a word seemed legible, and none
of it was intelligible. “Goodness,” murmured
Cynthia, and looked about her. Could she get
up and leave, and try another place? But the
waiter had already placed a napkin beside her,
fork and knife beside the napkin. Cynthia decided
she hadn’t the moral courage to rise and
depart. Well, here goes!</p>

<p>“Bring me some of that, and that, and that,”
she directed and pointed near the center of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
page. The main body of a meal always came
near the middle of the menu, didn’t it?</p>

<p>The waiter, who wore a spotty black dinner
jacket and a white apron, broke into a voluble
explanation of some sort. Evidently they were
out of this, would mademoiselle not prefer that?
Mademoiselle nodded in agreement. Yes, anything.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui, oui!</i> The waiter departed on
swift feet. Cynthia wondered what he would
bring.</p>

<p>What he brought was a strange piece of pink
meat swimming in a cold bath of oil. This she
poked about with a fork, wondering what particular
portion of what animal it might be. It
hardly seemed edible, and certainly though she
was hungry, she was not yet hungry enough for
that. After a long time the waiter seemed to
appreciate that she had finished with that course,
and brought her some hot boiled potatoes.
These were more palatable. And bread helped
too. Then came a small white something
wrapped in tin foil, and served with a large salt
shaker.</p>

<p>But the foil proved to contain a small roll of
really delicious cream cheese, and eaten with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
sugar, which came from the large salt shaker,
and more of the crisp French bread. It served
to round off the simple meal.</p>

<p>“I suppose I have eaten,” thought Cynthia
as she wandered home again. “I wish I weren’t
still so hungry. At least that meal was cheap,
and that’s important at the moment.” But she
continued to think of hot beefsteaks, and hot
muffins, and hot chicken pies, and what she
wouldn’t do to a big plate of ham and eggs. ...
Oh dear! But tomorrow she’d try another place.
Perhaps that wasn’t a really good example of
French cooking.</p>

<p>As she strolled slowly back towards the hotel
all the little bands were going full force. Cynthia
noticed that people were beginning to
dance, under the lights, on the hard cobbled
pavements to the jiggling, monotonous tunes.
She leaned for a while against the closed iron
shutter of a shop, and watched the gay crowds
gather. They seemed very happy. Was it some
celebration, she wondered, or did French people
always dance like this in the evening? The
musicians beneath her window were in fine fettle,
tootling, sawing, and bumping away at no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
particular tune, but just a sort of penny whistle
noise with a strongly marked rhythm for the
dancers.</p>

<p>She sat in her window watching them till she
got so sleepy she could no longer keep her eyes
open, then deciding they’d probably keep it up
pretty late, till ten or maybe eleven, crawled
into bed. It had been a long day since Cherbourg
that morning, and in spite of the band,
which surely must stop before midnight, she
thought she could sleep.</p>

<p>But the monotonous, tuneless sound seemed to
go round, and round, and round inside her head.
She dreamed that she was waltzing rapidly with
the <a name="garcon" id="garcon"></a><ins title="Original has 'garcon'"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</i></ins> of the striped waistcoat, with Madame
in her black taffeta dress and wide gold
chain, with the black cat of the restaurant.
Then woke to hear the band still scraping, and
bumping merrily. Foggily she struggled out of
bed and closed first the heavy wooden shutters,
then the window and went back to sleep with her
head hot under the bedclothes. Twice she woke
again at odd hours, but always that rhythm penetrated
the darkness.</p>

<p>Then she woke again. Surprisingly all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
still. How blissful that was! She was sure the
musicians had stopped only a short time ago, and
waited tensely to see if they would start again.
But there was no sound. Then rolling over
with aching head she saw that light streamed
from between the chinks of the shutters, and
that her watch said seven o’clock.</p>

<p>She opened her window, went back to bed and
slept till nine. Then she wandered out to find
breakfast. Only a gnawing hunger had made
her get up at all.</p>

<p>Strangely enough none of the restaurants
seemed to be open. She peered in at two, between
drawn net curtains, to see chairs piled on
empty tables, and boys washing down the floors.
Then rounding a corner Cynthia came full on
the Seine, between its gray stone banks, and a
gray stone bridge beyond which loomed, full in
the summer sunlight, the twin towers of Notre
Dame de Paris. Oh lovely!</p>

<p>Along the embankment were the tiny stalls
of the booksellers, all closed now. Didn’t Paris
people go to work until noon, she wondered?</p>

<p>Then at the end of the block, facing a small
open square she saw a sign which read “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Chocolat</i>.” Here, perhaps, she could get some
sort of meal. Outdoors, under a gay striped
awning she found a little wicker table with a
red and white top, and wicker chairs. A big
black cat with a white bib, and green eyes gave
her welcome with purrs and ankle rubbings.
This was going to be jolly. She stammered her
desire for chocolate, and learned that “little
breads,” and butter could also be procured, and
that little breads were really crisp warm rolls.</p>

<p>Notre Dame faced her, serene, solid, impregnable.
When breakfast was over she’d go across
and visit the church, and stroll along by the
river. This must be the famous Left Bank,
where all the artists and students lived.</p>

<p>The cat rubbed, purring, about the table, and
a small boy with eyes as softly dark as the cat’s
fur, and clad in a diminutive smock of black,
with a small black beret perched on his dark
curls came out to stare solemnly at this stranger.
Cynthia buttered a piece of roll, and offered it to
him. With a shy, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</i>” muttered in an
oddly deep voice he took it, bolted it, and
watched for the next mouthful. Cynthia
grinned at him, ate a bit herself and gave him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
thereafter, alternate bites. By the time two
rolls were finished, and the big pitcher of hot
chocolate was drained to the last sweet drop, the
small boy had smiled also, had told her that his
name was Nono, and that he lived here. Here
at last was a friend. Tomorrow she’d bring a
sketchbook to breakfast.</p>

<p>When tomorrow came Nono appeared, along
with his black cat, for more bits of warm roll.
But this time he smiled immediately, crinkling
his dark eyes with an amused and delightful
welcome. When his father brought the chocolate,
he said something in brief reproof, but
Cynthia protested. “Let him stay,” she begged
and displayed her sketchbook.</p>

<p>The man grinned and nodded. He knew
about artists, and explained to the boy that he
must sit still for mademoiselle. Whereat Nono
climbed into one of the café chairs, and grasping
firm hold of the huge and somewhat reluctant
cat, proceeded to demonstrate that he was
born to be an artist’s model.</p>

<p>Oh, this was glorious. Cynthia’s fingers flew
to get it all down before it could dissolve, and
when the cat finally went calmly to sleep, Nono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
continued to sit immovable, wide eyed, minutes
on minutes. Cynthia got more and more thrilled.
It was going to be a honey of a sketch. She
wondered if, maybe, colors tomorrow. ...</p>

<p>At last she nodded to the child. He laughed
and stretched, and dumped the sleeping cat from
his knees. Cynthia put two francs in his small
hand. Was that, she wondered, too much, or
too little? It was what her breakfast had cost
her. Apparently, by his reception, it was all
right.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow?” she asked in French, and
pointed toward the chair again.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui, oui, Demain</i>,” agreed Nono. Then he
must know that artists sometimes wanted one
to pose again.</p>

<p>That was on Sunday. Saturday had not been
strikingly successful. For some reason, perhaps
because it was Saturday, everything, banks and
the Express Company, Mr. Culbert’s office and
most of the museums Cynthia wished to visit,
had been closed. Monday, of course, they would
be open again, and she could get in touch with
Mr. Culbert. Cynthia’s money was running
low and she must ask for an advance on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
cover, and must find some way to get in touch
with models to work from.</p>

<p>But Monday was no better than Sunday, nor
than Saturday had been. The band, for the
third time, had played all night, and Cynthia
had slept fitfully, hot and miserable in the
closed, noisy room. She awoke feeling as
though she could sleep for a week. Then she
remembered Nono. Here at last was one bright
spot in Paris. She hurried out to breakfast with
her large sketch pad and her color box under her
arm.</p>

<p>Nono was waiting for her, and so was the
black cat. Cynthia was ravenously hungry. A
continental breakfast wasn’t enough food to last
one through a day of sightseeing, and so far she
had found no good place to eat. Hastily she
drank her chocolate, shared a double order of
rolls and butter with the somewhat greedy little
Nono. She herself was anxious to get to work
on this color sketch.</p>

<p>Nono, complete with the large sleepy cat,
clambered into his wicker chair. The sunlight
reflected warm and yellow beneath his chin and
his eyes were half closed, amusingly, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
glare. The black smock seemed almost a dark
green in contrast to the cat’s soft fur, and beyond
them was the red and white ruffle of the awning,
a brilliant splash of warm color. Cynthia asked
to have her little painting pail filled with water,
sketched in the brief outline of her composition,
and slashed happily into color. Once she said,
mechanically “Rest!” and found that the boy
understood. In a few minutes he returned to his
place. The cat was a little different, but Cynthia
had allowed for that, and now sketched him
in and completed that part of the drawing all in
one pose.</p>

<p>The drawing was emerging with both charm
and strength. Black, red and warm flesh tones
accented with the green of the cat’s eyes, and
one white paw lifted to rest against Nono’s black
smock. This, thought Cynthia, was one of the
nicest things she had ever done. Even fatigue
and hunger seemed to have added to her ability
since her senses seemed sharpened, nerves tautened
by the past two days.</p>

<p>She had decided to go that afternoon and find
the little French girl Mrs. Brewster had recommended
for language lessons. Her visit to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Express Company, and to the office where she
had hoped to find Mr. Culbert were as unsuccessful
as Saturday’s visits. Everything was still
closed tight.</p>

<p>Cynthia was beginning to worry. She had
only a few hundred francs, about fifteen dollars,
left in her purse and there was no telling how
long this celebration might last. It puzzled her.
She had asked Madame at the desk and had
learned that it was the “Fourteenth of July,”
whatever that was! But Friday had been the
fourteenth. Surely they didn’t celebrate America’s
Fourth of July over here, did they? Foggily
she tried to connect it with Lafayette and
the two Revolutions, but couldn’t make it out.
Everywhere the little street bands continued to
play and people continued to dance in the streets.</p>

<p>Still pondering on this mystery she found the
house on the Boulevard St. Michel that bore the
address of the Mademoiselle Menard. Mrs.
Brewster had explained that she lived on the
fifth floor and that “in France the first floor is
not the ground floor, nor the next, which is
called the entresol. You have to go up two
flights to get to the first floor and then begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
count from there!” They were long flights,
too, and Cynthia had begun to feel a little faint
by the time she reached the top. When she
found Mr. Culbert, if she ever did, she would
certainly beg him to take her out for a real
dinner!</p>

<p>Cynthia put her finger on the large white push
button and a bell pealed somewhere way off inside.
But no one answered it. After a bit she
tried again, and then again. What should she
do next? She already had visited Notre Dame,
and knew the Cluny and Luxembourg Gardens,
for the past two days, as well as the palm of her
hand. Besides she still felt strangely faint. She
leaned <a name="against" id="against"></a><ins title="Original has 'againt'">against</ins> the heavy stone balustrade and
looked down.</p>

<p>Suddenly up through the hallway, wafted
from below came the most glorious and enchanting
odor. Cynthia closed her eyes. It made her
think of home, of a loaded dinner table with big
plates of corned-beef hash, with an egg on top,
slabs of bread and butter, and a thick slice of
apple pie with cheese. Oh dear!</p>

<p>Like a good little hound following the scent,
Cynthia, hypnotized by that delicious smell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
stepped down, step after step, to the floor below.
Still that beckoning, delightful odor. Another
flight. It was stronger now, over the banisters.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” thought Cynthia. “How can I
ever stand this?”</p>

<p>Here was the door and she had tracked it to its
lair. A door, heavy and thick and solid, like
those above. It was open just a crack, which
was why the lovely smell had wandered out.
Cynthia leaned against the doorpost. There
were tears of hunger and of homesickness in her
eyes as she sniffed ... and sniffed. Onions
in that hash, too! No calves head in cold oil
here, no tough thin steaks that might, or might
not, be horsemeat!</p>

<p>Then the door opened with a <em>whoosh</em> and Cynthia
almost fell through it into the hall beyond.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">’Ello!</i>” said a cheery voice in French. Another
girl, shorter than Cynthia but about her
own age, with an amusing long nose, twinkly
brown eyes, her hair covered by a chic little
straw hat with a red quill, a white wool dress
embroidered in red.</p>

<p>The girl continued to chatter something in
French. Cynthia looked as blank as a brick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
wall; she had been wrenched all too suddenly
from that corned-beef-hash day-dream.</p>

<p>“Say!” cried the girl suddenly. “You’re an
American, too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Cynthia could have hugged her, right then
and there. Why she hadn’t heard a word of
English for three whole days.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>yes!</em>” she almost shouted. “And oh,
is that hash you are cooking?”</p>

<p>The girl giggled, then sniffed appreciatively.
“Does smell good, doesn’t it? Mother’s a swell
cook. Look here ...” she opened the door
that had half closed behind her. “Hey,
Mums, have we got enough for a guest?” and
before Cynthia could object, had shoved her
ahead, down the hallway, into a wide room lit by
late sunlight.</p>

<p>“Take off your mittens and bonnet and
shawl,” laughed the girl. “You’re invited to
dinner ... that is if you can stay. Mums,
this is Miss America, winner of all beauty prizes
to date, isn’t she pretty? ...” Heavens how
the girl did rattle on, thought the amused Cynthia. ...
“I found her fainting on our doorstep
and brought her in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
“Mums” was wide and comfortable looking
in a huge white apron and carried a turning-spoon
in her hand. She seemed unperturbed by
her daughter’s nonsense.</p>

<p>“My name’s Wanstead, Cynthia,” explained
the owner of that name. “And I do hope you
will forgive me. I sniffed your delicious cooking
two flights up.”</p>

<p>“Good grief, I must have left that door open
again!” rattled the girl. “We’d just about lose
our French lease if they sniff our cooking in the
hall. Oh, I forgot, my name is Murchison.
This is Mrs. Murchison, my honored parent. ...
Listen I’ve got to run out with some letters
for the post. Sit still and I’ll be back in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Cynthia was only too glad to sit. Normally
she would have protested more strongly against
their forced hospitality, but today, homesick
and genuinely hungry and considerably worried
about the future, she found this American
household irresistible. Mrs. Murchison puttered
into the room and out again murmuring
absentmindedly: “Father loves corn-beef
hash. ... Can’t get French cook to make it
properly. ... Marie, our cook, gone home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for the holidays ...” and still murmuring disappeared
at last in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Over the delicious dinner Cynthia heard the
story of the mysterious holiday. “It’s the Jour
de Bastille,” Alice explained to her, “in celebration
of the destruction of that beastly prison.
The French never have a half-holiday. They
save it up and make four days of it. Father’s
in the consular service and had to be home for
tomorrow morning, but most Americans who
live here plan to stay out of Paris during these
four days, they’re so noisy. Our cook won’t be
worth her salt for the next week, she’ll be so
sleepy. If you ask me, you look half asleep.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had one of those bands under my window
for the past three nights,” apologized Cynthia.
“Please, can I have some more hash?”</p>

<p>“Save room for real American ice cream,”
advised her hostess, and, when dinner was over,
“I’m going to tuck you into bed right away, you
poor thing. It’s only seven and you can sleep
till ten or eleven. Then I’ll wake you to go
home. Come on, my room is at the back, on the
garden, you won’t hear a single drum or whistle
or even a taxi horn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Cynthia was too weary to utter more than a
feeble protest. “It seems kind of funny to
break into a stranger’s house, eat their hash and
go to sleep in their bed,” she murmured as she
slipped off her shoes.</p>

<p>“Take off your dress. That’s right. I’ll
just throw a blanket over you and open this window
a little. Sleep <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doucement!</i>”</p>

<p>Cynthia started to call, “Don’t fail to wake
me,” but must have been asleep before she could
speak the words. At least when she awoke an
apparent few minutes later the sentence still
hung unuttered, in her mind. She stretched,
blinked, fumbled for her thoughts, then glared
at the window. It was full daylight!</p>

<p>Frantically she bent to look at her watch. It
had stopped. Then it <em>was</em> next day? The little
clock on the bureau said “eight o’clock” and then
Alice, tousle headed, in bright pink candy-striped
pyjamas peeped round the edge of the door.</p>

<p>“Hello you! Gosh how you did sleep! Are
you by any chance a descendant of the Sleeping
Beauty? I phoned your hotel so they wouldn’t
think you had got run over, and went in to sleep
with Mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
She pranced into the room and perched on
the foot of the bed. “It’s a swell day. And
things started to move again today. You’ll find
your little editor chap, no doubt. Will you have
your breakfast on a tray in here, milady, and go
back to sleep again?”</p>

<p>“Goodness no! Oh, I feel fine.” Cynthia
swung her feet out of bed.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon, however, when Cynthia
sent her name to Mr. Culbert, the editor of
<cite>Little Ones’ Magazine</cite>. He came out immediately,
a plump little man with a round jolly
face and held out both hands, beaming his welcome.</p>

<p>“Such a shame you landed here in the middle
of the holiday. I was down in the south of
France with the owner of the magazine, but got
back last night. Now, my dear child, about
those covers of yours, I suppose you want to
get right at them. About models ... that’s
going to be a bit difficult. Children, you
know. ...”</p>

<p>“Not a bit difficult.” Cynthia’s eyes were
dancing. “I’ve been working,” she said demurely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“What, not already? Well, you are a wonder!
Oh, you’ve got something there? Come
into the office, will you? This is just a borrowed
place and I hate it. Drat these French chairs.
I like a good old swivel chair I can lean back in.
Shall be glad to get back to the States myself.
Now let’s see. ...”</p>

<p>He had chatted incessantly as he led the way
into a room resembling more a window display
of a decorator’s shop than an office. Cynthia
perched on the corner of the elaborate inlaid
desk and slipped the wrapper off her drawing,
the one Nono, over her second breakfast, had
finished posing for, just a half hour ago.</p>

<p>“Here you are.” She knew it was good.
Would he think so too? Gosh, he liked it! She
could tell by his face.</p>

<p>“Sa ... ay, that’s fine. My dear child,
you have certainly surpassed anything you have
done yet.” He set it on the floor, propped
against the wall and leaned back to squint at it.</p>

<p>It was nice to be praised and Cynthia felt herself
getting warm and pink cheeked. Yes, she
knew Nono had been her best effort ... to
date. “There’ll be better ones, though,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
told the little editor. “I’m going to Brittany
next week to join the Brewsters, and to paint.
I’ll do you a Breton child for the issue after
this one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Culbert got up and took her arm. “Now
we’ll go and get a check made out for this. I
know you can always use money in Paris. And
then how about a celebration dinner tonight,
some place where they have marvelous French
cooking?”</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed. “I can do better than that,
I’ve got an invitation for you, instead. We’re
both invited to a really American meal. Please,
<em>do</em> you like corned beef hash?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nancy’s</span> rapid, fluent French gave directions
to the small, sabot shod boy who dragged behind
him a blue painted hand cart. Then she turned
to bestow an additional hug on the waiting Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is grand to see you. And how
brown you will get here! Come along. François’ll
bring your luggage in his perambulator.”</p>

<p>Cynthia drew a deep whiff of the ocean
scented air. “Ouff! ’S nice to get on solid
ground again. I feel inches deep in train dirt
and trolley dust. How sweet the air smells,
Nancy.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see the broad Atlantic in a moment or
two, just over that way a few blocks. We have
to walk about a half mile to the bathing beach,
but it’s a beauty when you get there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Cynthia gave a little skip of delight. “How’s
your especially nice parent?” she asked.</p>

<p>“She’s always lovely. At the moment she’s
in a seventh heaven, having donned a disreputable
paint-smeared smock, stuck an old straw
hat on her head, and is painting ocean foam and
wet rocks, laying the color on the canvas with
a trowel! She’s awfully glad to be free of the
illustration business for a time, if you ask me.
But you’ll see her soon. She gets hungry and
comes home to meals.” Nancy babbled on and
Cynthia had a chance to see how brown and
strong she looked, how much good the summer
in this tiny provincial town was doing her.</p>

<p>“We turn here, to the right. This, ladieeze
and gen’lemen, is the main and principal street
of Le Conquet, the most wester-r-r-n town in
all France. Sweet, isn’t it, Cindy?”</p>

<p>It was, Cynthia admitted, adorable. Old and
gray and cobblepaved, with a tiny, one-pedestrian
sidewalk along one wall, and with
little two- and three-story houses of old, pearly-gray
stone whose tiny windows opened intimately
close to the street, as did the heavy
wooden doors. Green lichened roofs sloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
steeply, and there were red geraniums blooming
in open windows between blowing red and
green checked curtains, to give color to the mellow
softness of the ancient stone.</p>

<p>“Our American hero, Mr. Jones, used to put
in here, they say,” remarked Nancy casually.</p>

<p>“What Mr. Jones?” asked Cynthia, then at
Nancy’s deepening dimple, always an index to
her mood, suspected a trap. “Who was Mr.
Jones?”</p>

<p>“Why surely you remember John Jones, of
the U. S. Navy? No? ... Not Mr. John <em>Paul</em>
Jones?”</p>

<p>“Beast!” laughed Cynthia, then “Tell me
some more.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you know, this is the Department
of Finisterre, Lands End, and is the farthest
west of all western provinces. Some centuries
ago, dunno how many, but not long, it belonged
to England and the people here are closer to the
southwest-of-England type than you could
imagine.”</p>

<p>They turned a corner, past a wide lipped stone
well where a woman dipped water in a huge,
creamy-toned pitcher. Cynthia murmured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
“Wait till I can get to my sketch book!” and
Nancy nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“Then the French got it back,” she continued,
“and perhaps the English again after
that. Anyway the English burnt it a couple of
times, though there were still some English
families living here, but spared the houses in
which they lived. That’s why there are still
some very old places, in spite of the conquerors.
Here’s the quay. You must get out your canvas
sneakers, these cobbles are death on good leather
shoes. Wooden sabots are best, though I’ve
never tried ’em.”</p>

<p>The tiny hotel smelled pleasantly of soap and
good Breton cooking. One went steeply up two
flights of stairs to a narrow hall and turned into
a small, whitewashed room with a dresser, a
wash stand and a white covered bed. The single
window overlooked the long stretch of quay
and the tidal river, very low now and turning
to marvelous lavender in the sunset light.</p>

<p>“My room is next door, and mother’s beyond
that. Here are your things. I brought you the
longest way so you could see the town&mdash;Goodness,
you aren’t catching a cold are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Cynthia sneezed again. “I hope not. But a
small child in the train from Paris had frightful
snuffles, right in my own compartment, and it
was sort of drafty on the trolley from Brest.”</p>

<p>Promising to hurry, she closed the door and
went to the window to hang out, gazing.
Wooden shoes clattered merrily on the cobbles
of the quay, and along the distant dunes, purpling
with dusk, smoke rose from the smouldering
potash fires where, Nancy had said, the
thrifty Bretons burned seaweed for fertilizer.</p>

<p>She was pleasantly weary and very hungry.
All last night she had been traveling, more than
half the width of France from Paris to Brest.
Uncle Leslie had sailed from Brest after the
Armistice, she remembered, and its steep streets
and ancient houses, built on half a dozen different
levels, had fascinated her during the hours
she had to wait for her trolley to Le Conquet.</p>

<p>It had been surprisingly hard to leave Paris.
That city had changed for her, almost overnight.
She could have stayed on there, almost
happily, doing paintings and more paintings,
digging herself in. <em>Almost</em> happily, but not
quite. After all, she could have done that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
New York. And what was the use of keeping
on with a thing, once you had learned you
could really do it, once you had met it and
conquered it? While she was over here it was
up to her to travel, learn, experiment, grow.</p>

<p>And here, right outside the window was her
first view of a real French village. How different
from Paris, how quaint and sweet and
clean&mdash;and oh, how paintable it was going to be.
No wonder Nancy’s famous artist mother
planned to spend her summer here. Perhaps
Mrs. Brewster would be able to tell her how to
find a model for the next cover, the Christmas
number of <cite>Little One’s Magazine</cite>. Cynthia
wanted to paint a little dark eyed Breton girl or
boy, in wooden shoes and quaint cap for that
December number.</p>

<p>Goodness, there was the dinner gong! Cynthia
pulled in her head just in time to face Nancy
at the door. “Mother just came up stairs.
Want to come say hello?”</p>

<p>Cynthia sneezed and fumbled in her suitcase
for a clean handkerchief. “Just a moment,
Nan. I’ve been so busy just looking that I
haven’t had time to get washed or combed. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
where did I put those hankies? Pour out the
water, will you honey? So I can wash. Oh
... darling Mrs. Brewster!”</p>

<p>Nancy’s mother, as pretty as ever, tanned
from sea bathing, seemed hardly older than her
daughter. “We’re so glad to have you here,
my child. I want to hear all about your covers,
and see what you’ve been doing. Nancy tells
me you’ve already completed one painting, in
Paris&mdash;Here’s the dining room, and this is our
table.”</p>

<p>There were several painters and two writers
among the jolly little crowd at the Hotel Des
Poissons. Cynthia got a tremendous thrill out
of having these older people, all professional
craftsmen of proved ability, regard her with
respect and as an artist already “arrived.” Yet
she was, after all, also a professional, traveling,
actually seeing the world on what she earned
with her brush and pencil. When she stopped
to think about that, Cynthia always felt like a
fairy-tale-princess who has rubbed the magic
ring. But generally she was too busy to think
about it.</p>

<p>The next morning Nancy took her to explore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the little town, not a long tour, for there were
not six streets in the whole place. The ancient
sturdy houses, facing the sea for half a dozen
centuries seemed to grow from the very rock on
which they were built. Below the hotel one
crossed a bridge, at high water, or walked on a
raised path across the sands, at low tide, to a long
sandy beach bordered with dunes and tall waving
grasses, very white and flat and clean.</p>

<p>Cynthia surveyed the clear stretch of deserted
sand, and Nancy’s brief little bathing suit with
a longing eye. “I won’t go swimming for a day
or two, I guess,” she decided. “This cold
doesn’t seem to get any better and I’d rather not
risk it.” She wondered if she were being old-maid
fussy about herself.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a delightfully informal meal,
at almost any hour of the morning, and in the inn
parlor, not the dining room. Here the ceiling
quivered with reflections from the sunspangled
river.</p>

<p>On the second morning Nancy brought to
breakfast a large, mysterious bag, and when she
had received her huge bowl of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café au lait</i>, weak
coffee made with milk, she opened the paper bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and dumped a handful of what appeared to be
rolled oats, raw, into her bowl.</p>

<p>“What on earth is that?” asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>“That’s my breakfast food, want to try
some?”</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head, “Goodness no. But
where can you get breakfast food, American
style, in a paper bag, in a French village?”</p>

<p>“Feed store,” mumbled Nancy around her
large spoonful. “It’s just chicken feed. Bran.
I get so hungry by noon, with these continental
breakfasts.”</p>

<p>“How about an egg?” was Cynthia’s suggestion.
“Soft boiled.”</p>

<p>“Try and get it.” Nancy’s tone was amused.</p>

<p>Cynthia struggled with the hard-to pronounce
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oeuf</i>. Shortly it came, all alone on a
small dish. It was hot, so it must have been in
hot water. But when she broke it ... “Ugh!
It’s completely raw!”</p>

<p>“They simply won’t boil it any longer, unless
you want a twenty minute egg, like a rock,” explained
Nancy. “It’s one of the unsolved mysteries
of the French cuisine. You’ll come to
chicken-feed yet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Meanwhile the time was passing. Cynthia
had arrived on a Thursday, Sunday had rolled
round, her Christmas cover must go off to Paris
this week, and she seemed no nearer it than the
week before. In fact, so far, she hadn’t seen
any children that looked paintable.</p>

<p>“They are pretty enough,” she mourned, at
breakfast on Sunday. “But it’s merely a matter
of color with them. I haven’t seen a single child
that I thought would make a good poster cover.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster nodded. “I know. But some
of the old people are marvelous. There are no
better types for models of old people in all of
France.”</p>

<p>“But not for the Christmas cover of a children’s
magazine. Unless ... there is a thought,
I give them a Breton Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>“No whiskers on ’em here.” Nancy was most
discouraging. “What have you to suggest,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“Hark, there’s the church bell. I suggest
that you two hurry into your best bonnets and
shawls and go to church. All the village will
be there and you will have a good chance
<a name="to" id="to"></a><ins title="Original has 'to to'">to</ins> look them over. Then if you find what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
want I’ll ask Madame, our patronne, to introduce
us. Hurry now!”</p>

<p>It was a splendid idea, Cynthia admitted, as
she followed Nancy into the little stone church.
Surely every good Breton inhabitant of Le Conquet
was present, the women in wide skirts
trimmed with bands of black velvet, with full
sleeves, and tight black bodices setting off the
lace-trimmed white aprons, the frosty white
caps of Breton lace and the wide lace collars.
Here at least, all the lovely quaintness of medieval
<a name="not" id="not"></a><ins title="Original has 'France had not,'">France had not</ins>
gone down before the stupid
uniform of store-bought gingham dresses.</p>

<p>The men were no less picturesque, with their
low crowned wide brimmed hats, the shining
silver buttons on their short, black velvet coats.
And each child was a miniature replica of its
parents, with the exception of the caps which
mark the married women.</p>

<p>The small bleak church was warmed to light
by the rustle of many garments, by the soft glow
of candles and Cynthia was enchanted by the
little ship-models that swung from the hand
hewn rafters, all of them as perfect as skill and
loving care could make them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
“They are thank offerings for the safe return
of the ships they represent,” Nancy whispered
to her. “Oh look, Cindy; isn’t she a darling?”
Her elbow nudged for Cynthia’s attention.</p>

<p>The minute Cynthia saw her, her artist’s eye
registered her as the one model for that Christmas
cover. Such pansy-brown eyes, such soft
curls around the little pink-cheeked face, such a
dimpled round chin above the starched white
collar and the tight little bodice, like a small
child playing at grown-up.</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded her approval of Nancy’s
choice. “How nice,” she thought, “to be with
artists again. Oh, I wish they could be with me
all over France,” remembering her loneliness
in Paris.</p>

<p>After the service they edged their way toward
the door, Cynthia keeping the child in
sight all the way. The little girl’s mother, who
walked behind her, was a larger edition of the
same type and must have been lovely when she
was young, but was now bent and weary eyed,
like so many of the hard working Breton peasants.</p>

<p>Nancy’s eyes had been roving the church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Now she gave Cynthia a reassuring nod. “Wait
for me outside,” she commanded and wriggled
away through the crowd. Cynthia, who was
taller than most of the villagers, saw her stop at
last before a woman in black and wearing a hat.
Their own patronne from the hotel, very much
in her Sunday best. Nancy waved to Cynthia,
then the two disappeared, blotted out by the congregation.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she joined Cynthia in the
little square above the fountain. “It’s all right,”
she reported triumphantly. “We identified
your model and her mother, and Madame says
she will ask her about posing.”</p>

<p>That was fine. Cynthia already saw her
cover, painted, delivered, printed, and exhibited
on every Christmas news stand in New York.
She drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>They strolled back toward the hotel and the
pleasant smell of Sunday dinner, the crowd
slowly trickling away behind them. The little
bakery was already doing a brisk business, for
many of these small shops opened as soon as the
church was out. Cynthia’s eyes caught a new
poster on the bakery wall, a single sheet of vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
lemon yellow with blue and red type, such a
bright patch of color in the pearly gray street
that she hauled Nancy along to look at it.</p>

<p>“Well ...” after a minute of Nancy’s silent
contemplation. “What does it say, stupid?
Can’t you read out loud, the way you were
taught?”</p>

<p>Nancy chuckled. “Sorry, I forgot. Well,
‘Hypnotiste’ means ‘Hypnotist.’”</p>

<p>“I gathered as much as that. What comes
after it?”</p>

<p>“‘World renowned Professor Reynaldo.’
That sounds Spanish but he says he’s from
Paris&mdash;‘Parisien’&mdash;will be here on Tuesday
evening to give a demonstration of his stupendous
and altogether unexplainable power of the
human eye,” Nancy translated loosely. “It also
says his demonstration will be held in the meat
market. ... I suppose that’s the biggest room
they have, except the church, and that admission
will be one and two francs. Standing room
fifty centimes. Poor thing, he can’t make much
of a living out of that.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” suggested Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Eh? ... Well ... yes.” Then as the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
struck her. “I think it would be fun. Maybe
mother would like to go. Let’s ask her now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster was amused at the idea and
quite willing they should go, but refused to be
a third of the party. “Not if it’s to be held in the
meat market. I never could stand the odor of
so many sides of beef and mutton. But you
children go along. I’m sure you will find it an
amusing cross section of the peasant’s amusement.
I believe they have never had a hypnotist
here before.”</p>

<p>But Cynthia very nearly didn’t get to the entertainment
after all. For on Sunday afternoon
she went swimming with Nancy. It was an
hour or two after dinner, the warmest part of
the day when the girls took their bathing suits
and crossed the little path across the tidal river.
The way straggled along the top of a high, wind-torn
meadow where coarse grasses tangled about
the feet and where, on the rocks below, the sea
piled, churning among the crevices. But the
further side of this little peninsula was the bathing
beach, quite wild and deserted, and one could
choose any of a hundred grass-grown sand dunes
for a dressing room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Nancy had raced on ahead, and Cynthia
sneezed twice, and wondered if she ought to go
for this swim, after all. She wrestled with her
conscience for a bit ... and conscience lost.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful swim, but about midnight
Cynthia awoke with such a sore throat she could
scarcely whisper. “Oh, darn!” she murmured
feverishly. “What a bother! I do hope
I’m not going to be sick!”</p>

<p>She lay for a bit thinking about that, then
rapped gently beside her bed. She heard
Nancy’s springs creak, heard her mutter something
sleepily, and in a moment the light of
Nancy’s candle appeared beneath the crack of
the door. The crack widened and a sleepy voice
asked, “Did you rap, honey? Oh, you poor
thing! Cynthia, you are a wreck!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster was called immediately and
then Madame. Together they applied a hot,
oily cloth to Cynthia’s throbbing throat, a funny
aluminum hot-water bottle to her feet, and gave
her a dose of something else, equally unpleasant
and equally hot. Then she was given something
to breathe on a handkerchief ... Cynthia muttered
that it nearly blew off the top of her head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
but it did miraculously clear her nose for its
original purpose of breathing.</p>

<p>Next day she felt heaps and heaps better and
protested that she could easily get up. But she
was kept in bed till noon and then allowed out
only for a short stroll in the sunshine, equipped
with a handkerchief soaked in the breathing
stuff. “But no more bathing till you are quite
over this,” was the stern order of Nancy’s
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” murmured Cynthia meekly,
ashamed to have given them all such a fright.</p>

<p>There was, however, a final straw. At dinner
that night Madame reported that she had seen
the mother of the little girl, Leonie her name
was, and that the woman refused to let the child
pose for her portrait.</p>

<p>“But how silly,” stammered Cynthia. “What
is the matter? I’ll pay for her time of course.”</p>

<p>“It’s not that,” Mrs. Brewster explained
from Madame’s conversation. “But they are
rather afraid of artists. The few who come here
paint only the sea and the dunes. They aren’t
accustomed to the idea of artists’ models, not
even for portraits. This woman seems unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
simple and I suppose the word ‘posing’ made
her think of wicked Paris! I’m sorry, for I
think I might have persuaded her. Madame
probably didn’t know how to go about it tactfully. ...
If the woman could have met you. ...
But aren’t there others you can get? I’m sure
there must be.”</p>

<p>So that Christmas cover had gone to smash,
too! It would be hard to pick out another child,
after having seen Leonie. Perhaps she’d have
another opportunity to see the villagers at the
meeting on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster again gave her reluctant,
though amused, consent. “If you’ll take a fresh
handkerchief with some of that Breathex on
it. ...”</p>

<p>“Three of ’em,” promised Cynthia and
Nancy together.</p>

<p>“... And come straight home if you find
you’re in a draft, or if you start to sneeze.”</p>

<p>“We will,” came the chorus.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster laughed. “All right. And I
may sound fussy, but a tiny village in a foreign
country is no place for one to get ill. Now run
along and get ready for your show.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
They followed the crowd and the clomp of
wooden shoes to the meat market at the center
of the town. Here, in the big hall, benches&mdash;rough
boards on trestles&mdash;had been arranged
and the Professor himself stood at the improvised
ticket window.</p>

<p>“Shall we be extravagant and take a two-franc
ticket? Then we can sit in the front row,”
suggested Nancy.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” urged Cynthia. “What fun to have
eight cents buy so much luxury.”</p>

<p>The first two rows were very de luxe; benches
with backs, but so hard and narrow that Cynthia
was glad they had brought their coats for cushions.
The children, giggling and whispering,
somewhat awestruck by the promised entertainment,
crowded into the seats behind them, and in
the front rows sat the old ladies, some even with
their knitting, very straight and stiff and impressive.
There was a scuffle of sabots on the stone
floor and outside a tied sheep baa-a-a-ed plaintively.</p>

<p>Everyone peered and craned and turned heads
to see the two American mademoiselles, and discussed
them in friendly fashion, but quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
openly. Cynthia’s bright beret and red coat,
her gray eyes and dark curls, her shoes, her silk
stockings, the ring on her finger, were argued
and debated ... and relayed by Nancy in a choked
murmur.</p>

<p>“You are rich, since you wear a gold ring with
a greenglass stone in it. Someone suggests that
you are married, also because of the ring, but it
seems Madame at the hotel has reported that
you are still a ‘Mees,’ judging by your letters.
Oh, here is our professor!”</p>

<p>M’sieu Reynaldo, who had been at once ticket
taker and dispenser, usher, and frightener-away
of small boys who would press their snubby
noses against the windows, at last barred the
doors and strode proudly up the center, and only,
aisle. The stage was a rough platform on saw-horses,
beneath the light of a half dozen
dim, swinging lanterns, and was but a few feet
from the de luxe seats occupied by Cynthia and
Nancy.</p>

<p>“Look, Nancy; there’s my lost model, Leonie.
See, there at the end. Isn’t she a darling!”</p>

<p>“Sh-h,” Nancy nudged her. “He’s going to
begin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
The professor’s performance began with a
short talk on hypnotism, its great antiquity, its
meaning, and mostly of how wonderful he was
at that ancient art. How, with the supreme
power of his eye and a few passes of his hands&mdash;somewhat
soiled hands they were&mdash;he could
control his subjects and command them, thereafter
to do his bidding.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” murmured Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” muttered Nancy.</p>

<p>“I must have absolute quiet here, during my
demonstrations,” frowned the great Reynaldo.
He was a small, slender-boned man in a soiled
velvet jacket, and the jetty hair, the low brows,
the wide cheekbones of the typical lower class
Parisien&mdash;an amusing contrast to the bigger,
blonder, slow-moving Breton audience.</p>

<p>He asked first for two volunteers from the
audience. After considerable shy shuffling of
feet and chattering insistence on the part of their
feminine escorts, two boys were shoved forward,
down the aisle. Laughing, red with embarrassment,
the clumsy young fishermen mounted the
stage, then half numb with stage fright awaited
the next move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
A chorus of murmured advice came from the
interested and neighborly audience.</p>

<p>“Silence!” ordered the professor, with a flash
of his Paris-black eyes.</p>

<p>Then before the eyes of each volunteer he
made passes with his hand, gave a low murmured
command, and first one, then the other
became glassy eyed and appeared to go into a
waking sleep, there on the stage. The hall was
intensely still, hardly a foot stirred or a skirt
rustled.</p>

<p>Cynthia choked in her handkerchief. “Oh,
dear,” she thought. “I believe I’m going to
sneeze, and how shall we ever get out of here!”
But the scent on her handkerchief, though it
nearly strangled her, did put a halt to the sneeze.</p>

<p>“You are now asleep,” the Professor told his
subjects. “You will do exactly as I say. Lie
down and roll over.”</p>

<p>The two young men lay down on the platform
and rolled over. There was a murmur of
awe from the onlookers.</p>

<p>“Now this is a stairway and you are climbing
up it,” continued the orders. “Now open this
door,” where there was no door. “It is cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and windy out and the rain beats on your faces as
you open it.” The two staggered back, arms
over eyes as though they had indeed opened a
real door on a blast of wind and rain.</p>

<p>Cynthia was getting a little bored with this.
It seemed so onesided, so unsporting. The audience
tittered, but the boys were such simple
country lads it seemed unfair they should be
made a laughing stock like this. She didn’t
like that oily little man with his velvet coat and
his soiled hands. “I wish he’d stop,” she
thought.</p>

<p>The exhibition continued with various orders.
The subjects were given water to taste, an empty
glass to smell, but the Professor directed that
they smell or taste whatever he dictated, and
their faces amusingly registered disgust or delight
or surprise. Yes, they were funny, but
Cynthia felt uncomfortable and looked back
over her shoulder toward the bolted door. She
wished she hadn’t come.</p>

<p>Only once did the little professor nearly lose
his subjects. During a tense and silent moment
the sheep in the yard uttered a prolonged “Ba-a-ah!”
The audience giggled hysterically and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
one of the young men began to come to himself
again, looked around in a bewildered fashion
and walked to the edge of the platform.</p>

<p>The Professor waved his hands, snapped his
fingers. “Go, it is finished,” he commanded.</p>

<p>The two subjects blinked awake. If they
had been caught abroad in their nightshirts they
could not have looked more red and sheepish.</p>

<p>After that the renowned Reynaldo attempted
to hypnotize a small dog, a little fox terrier that
belonged to someone in the audience. The effort
was hardly a success, for the fox terrier didn’t
seem to realize he was a subject for the professor’s
art. But the audience, with the remembrance
of the former demonstration, was
properly impressed and after a bit the terrier
was allowed to go, barking his joy at the release,
unharmed to his master.</p>

<p>Again the Paris Professor called for volunteers,
asking this time for two little girls as he
had already demonstrated his power over grown
men. The children on the benches behind
Cynthia and Nancy giggled and nudged, “You
go ... no, you go ... Let M’rie go ... Let Leonie ...”
till five had been suggested and the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
making his choice, called two to the stage.</p>

<p>“Oh, there goes my little model,” murmured
Cynthia, really distressed. “Can’t we stop her,
Nancy?”</p>

<p>Nancy shook her head, her eyes on the stage.
“I don’t know how we could. After all, the
professor is French and we are just outsiders.
Better let them handle it themselves.”</p>

<p>Cynthia subsided meekly but kept an eye on
the little Leonie. What a lovely pose ... and
that one ... and the next. Why the child was
a born model, a picture in herself!</p>

<p>She was also excellent material for the hypnotist,
for she immediately obeyed his orders,
going to sleep bolt upright in her chair before
the professor’s waving, commanding hands. The
other little girl, older and of stouter stuff, though
not so easy a victim was also finally put to sleep.
To Cynthia’s relief Reynaldo used more discretion
in this case and satisfied his audience by having
the children do a little dance, by having
them appear to smell a rose when he gave them
an onion, seem to taste something sour when he
gave them a bonbon.</p>

<p>Then he asked if either of the girls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
musical. Someone in the audience volunteered
that Marie could sing but that Leonie could not
sing a note. He then commanded Leonie to
come forward and perform for them. “Sing
correctly,” he ordered, and named a little nursery
tune known to all French children.</p>

<p>The child really had a very pretty voice and
performed with considerable credit. Also her
friends seemed to think it marvelous that she
could sing at all. But Cynthia, stifling a sneeze
in her handkerchief, tapped a restless foot on
the stone floor.</p>

<p>Good, it was going to end! Monsieur Reynaldo
had commanded with a sharp clap of his
hand beside the ear of each child, that his subjects
come awake. M’rie blinked her china blue
eyes, smiled timorously and clattered down the
steps to join her friends.</p>

<p>But Leonie was a different matter. As Cynthia,
taking a deep breath of her “Breathex”
soaked handkerchief, watched with some interest,
then growing apprehension, it seemed that
the Professor also was becoming concerned.</p>

<p>To cover his own confusion, he ordered her
to get up, to walk across the stage, to do various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
things, all of which she performed with her
former obedience. But when he again made
passes before her eyes, then, in a low tone to
cover possible failure, again ordered her to
waken, she remained as soundly, as blank-eyed
asleep as before. The audience was apparently
undisturbed, and seemed to take all this as part
of the performance.</p>

<p>“I’m worried,” Cynthia confided to Nancy
through the muffling folds of her handkerchief.
“Oh, but this stuff is strong.” Her eyes were
streaming with tears, but so far she had managed
to keep back that sneeze.</p>

<p>“Worried?” Nancy turned big eyes on Cynthia.
“Do you mean to say ...”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he can get that child out of that
trance. I wonder ...”</p>

<p>Cynthia turned to look around the audience.
They too were beginning, unconsciously, to reflect
the professor’s concern. Quietly, three
times now, he had given his command, Cynthia’s
ears were abnormally keen, in spite of the
cold.</p>

<p>She glanced back again at the stage, then decided
what she would do. Evading Nancy she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
slipped out of her seat, past the two old ladies
who sat on the aisle. It was just a step to the
stage, a step or two across it. Leonie’s blank
stare did not turn to follow her, but Cynthia
knew that she had the attention of every other
soul in the house.</p>

<p>She smiled briefly at the bewildered professor
and crossed to the child. From her pocket she
drew a clean handkerchief soaked with the over-powering
scent of “Breathex.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Cynthia spoke in English in the
hope that the professor, being from Paris, knew
a little of that tongue, “if the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite enfant</i>
would like to smell this.” And before the hypnotist
could protest, had clapped the handkerchief
to Leonie’s little snub nose.</p>

<p>It was like a double dose of smelling salts.
The American makers would have been proud
of their preparation, though perhaps no such
strange application of it had ever been suggested
to them.</p>

<p>Leonie choked, coughed, strangled a moment.
But the blank left her eyes and she
struggled to escape the handkerchief. Bewildered,
for a moment she gazed at Cynthia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
then smiled shyly in a perfectly human, understanding
fashion.</p>

<p>Tactfully Cynthia withdrew. “Merci, Professor,”
she murmured and backed down the
steps.</p>

<p>She heard little of what followed. The Professor’s
florid explanation of this occurrence, of
the American’s interference with his demonstration,
but his willingness to let that pass ...
and so on and so on. The audience murmured
polite amazement, stared at Cynthia, clapped at
the end of Reynaldo’s speech, and began to rise
from their benches. The door swung open into
the sweet, starlit night.</p>

<p>“Well ...!” stated Nancy. “You certainly
distinguished yourself. Gosh, but that was a
close call for Leonie. Wonder what would have
happened ...”</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head. “But I knew something
must happen if she got a whiff of this. It
would have pulled a mummy back to life. Ah,
here’s Leonie.”</p>

<p>The child’s mother had appeared beside her,
holding her hand. She at least was not unaware
that the American Mees had done something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
though she wasn’t quite sure what, for her petite.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she murmured in shy, halting
English; then, that proving to be all she knew,
she broke into fluid French which almost
stumped Nancy to translate.</p>

<p>“She asks,” interpreted Miss Brewster, “if
there is anything she can do for the pretty
American ... make a bow, Cindy ... She says
she is very grateful to you and that it was very
naughty for her Leonie to go up on the stage
like that, before all the village. I’ve told her
that we will come tomorrow to pay our respects
to Leonie’s household. We’ll bring Mother
along, too. That all sounds sufficiently formal.”</p>

<p>They streamed out into the fan of light across
the cobbled road. The white caps and dark
dresses of the audience melted behind them into
darkness. The night was sweet and warm and
there was a sound of the sea on the rocks, far off.</p>

<p>“Good night,” called Cynthia. “Good
night!” then slipped her hand into Nancy’s arm.</p>

<p>“There,” said Nancy, “is your Christmas
cover, my dear, and in such a funny way.”</p>

<p>“<em>Aitchoo!</em>” sneezed Cynthia in eloquent reply.</p>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Mont St. Michel</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">“LITTLE MISS FIX-IT”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nancy’s</span> mother, who as a young art student
had lived in France, knew all the places that
Cynthia, as a younger art student, ought to see
and go.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she told Cynthia, “despise the well-worn
routes just because they are well-worn.
Later on you can go to the out of the way places
too. But you need the talked-about places as
a basis for comparison, just as you need to know
black and white in order to paint color.”</p>

<p>The idea interested Cynthia. “What do you
call the well-worn places.”</p>

<p>“Mother means those that are full of tourists
and trippers,” explained Nancy.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” said Mrs. Brewster, “Just
the sort of places you saw in Paris. The Louvre,
the tomb of Napoleon, Montmartre, the Arc de
<a name="Triomphe" id="Triomphe"></a><ins title="Original has 'Triomph'">Triomphe</ins>. You don’t need to rush through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
them, Baedecker in hand&mdash;though a guidebook
is always useful&mdash;like the American couple out
of Punch. ‘You see the outside Marthy, and I’ll
see the inside, and we’ll cut the time in half.’”</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed. She knew those tourists,
so intent on gathering data to relate at home that
they were blind to real beauty, to all the little
local color and pleasant customs of the people.
“But besides Paris, what would you suggest?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s Carcassonne, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh <em>yes!</em>” agreed Cynthia. Carcassonne had
been on her list too.</p>

<p>“Then I think you should see a bit of the
Basque country. It’s lovely, though it has become
a little self-conscious lately, with so many
books being written about it.”</p>

<p>Nancy had a suggestion here. “Don’t you
think Cynthia would adore Mouleon Soule?”
And Mrs. Brewster, agreeing, had promised a
letter of introduction to an old Basque artist
there. “And that will be real local color too.
Then there’s Rome and Venice and Florence ...”</p>

<p>Cynthia shook her head. Not much chance
of her getting to Italy, not unless the reward for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
capturing Goncourt, on the ship coming over,
should materialize. “Tell me some places near
here. Normandy, Brittany.”</p>

<p>“Mont St. Michel!” cried Nancy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster nodded. “I wonder ...” she
began.</p>

<p>Nancy took her up. “If we couldn’t go too?”</p>

<p>“Oh that would be wonderful!” cried Cynthia.
And so the matter was arranged.</p>

<p>Mont St. Michel was famous for four things;
its tides and the island with its mile long causeway
to land, its fortress abbey, and omelets.
Nature was responsible for the first two, Normandy
abbots and the wealth which William
of Normandy had filched from England, for the
second, and Madame Poulard now dead, but still
surviving in her reputation, for the third.</p>

<p>It was to partake of the third that Cynthia
was seated, on the evening of her first day at
Mont St. Michel, before a red checked cloth
covered table in the Hotel Tete D’or. It was
a distracting scent. The great arched room with
ceiling darkened by the smoke of many fires,
the enormous fireplace under the great cowled
chimney, and the fascinating process of mixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
that omelet which Madame <a name="Poulard" id="Poulard"></a><ins title="Original has 'Poularde'">Poulard</ins> had made
famous among gourmets all the world over.
And for a further distraction there was the
couple at the corner table; the man so dark and
slim and ... well, interesting looking, the girl
so pretty, and so angry. Cynthia’s attention was
doubly held, by the girl’s prettiness and by her
anger.</p>

<p>Nancy’s tug at her sleeve pulled Cynthia’s
attention back to the omelet making. This was
a ceremony, a rite in itself that people came from
all over the world to see. A huge bowl of sweet
butter, eggs, and the long handled iron skillet
held in Madam’s skillful hand. From the butter
she sliced a great golden gob, dumped it into
the pan and held it over the small fire in the big
fireplace.</p>

<p>“I knew the original Madam Poulard,” Mrs.
Brewster was saying. “She and her husband were
the handsomest couple in Normandy, or so it
was said. Look ... the eggs go in now.”</p>

<p>The little cook, plump and trim in her black
dress and neat white apron poured the golden
mass into the hot butter, stirred it slowly with a
long handled spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“Funny to think how small a thing, like an
omelet, can make a place famous,” mused Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Oh, but she made it an art. Like your child
portraits, Cynthia,” said Mrs. Brewster.</p>

<p>A delicious smell, wood smoke, butter, the
omelet. Cynthia grew ravenous just watching
the process. In another moment it would be
ready for them. And again her attention sought
the couple at the further table. The man looked
almost French, thin and wiry and intense, the
girl had buttercup hair that gleamed in the
lamplight, and slim, capable hands with which
she gestured as she talked.</p>

<p>The finished omelet was served piping hot
upon a plate warmed before the fire. When
Cynthia had finished the last delicious morsel
she looked up again. The party of two had
become three by the addition of an older man,
obviously the father of the girl.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’re engaged,” said Cynthia
turning the little emerald on her own slim finger.</p>

<p>“Who’s engaged, Cyn?” asked Nancy.
“Listen honey, try the raspberries, with sour
cream, they’re delicious.” But then Nancy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
back was toward the interesting couple so she
might be excused for a lack of interest. Mrs.
Brewster caught Cynthia’s eye and smiled.</p>

<p>“The man looks like a Basque,” she said.
“But I think the girl is American. I saw them
in our hotel this afternoon.”</p>

<p>The Brewsters, who with Cynthia had come
the short but complicated trip from Brittany that
morning, planned now to spend several days at
Mont St. Michel. After that Cynthia was reconciled
to traveling alone again. Meanwhile
she and Nancy could paint and explore the abbey
fortress and talk Academy gossip, there
wouldn’t be such another chance till Cynthia
got back to New York.</p>

<p>Exploration got under way immediately after
breakfast the next morning. Nancy with her
mother’s sketch box, Cynthia with the sketching
stool accompanied Mrs. Brewster up the steep
cobbled street of the tiny village.</p>

<p>“Just as far as half way up the hill,” directed
Mrs. Brewster. “There’s a small garden of
cabbages there that takes on the most heavenly
color in the sunlight. That is if the man has
planted cabbages this year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
The man had, and they were indeed heavenly.
Cynthia sucked in her breath at the beauty of
the color. One had not guessed that mere cabbages
could be so decorative.</p>

<p>Below them stretched stairs and more stairs
of the dark purplish brown stone of the island,
all the long, steep, curving way up which they
had come. Slowly the stairway had widened,
houses dropped away and now, level with the
eye, rose the second and third stories of the
fortress-like dwellings that fringed the town.
Chimneys incredibly thick threw long morning
shadows of rich blue on salmon pink walls and
grey tiled roofs. Round towers lent piquant
variety to the outlines and the incongruity of a
bedquilt stuffed through the window of a beetling
fortress, to air above a frowning keep,
made Cynthia’s fingers tingle for paper and pencil
with which to note it all down. Below the
windows, tiny gardens&mdash;something pinkish,
something ochre&mdash;Cynthia with eyes half closed
to shut out shapes of things saw only color where
some thrifty Normandy farmer had planted
provender for the coming winter. And cabbages,
so green they were almost blue, jewel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
vivid, jewel bright. Cynthia nodded. Tomorrow
she would bring her paint box.</p>

<p>“My stool, Cynthia dear.” Amusedly Mrs.
Brewster broke in on her reverie. “I’ll be here
for two hours at least. Run along and don’t fall
off any parapets or into any oubliettes.”</p>

<p>“What’s an oubliette?” asked Cynthia racing
upward beside Nancy.</p>

<p>“It’s a ‘forgettery,’” explained Nancy, “and
if that doesn’t mean anything to you, my child,
it’s an extremely graphic name for the trap-door,
underground dungeons that they used to
drop you into if you offended a king or an abbot.
Monte Cristo stuff, you know. I believe this
place is simply riddled with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Horrid people, kings and abbots!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but they could build. Look up, honey!”</p>

<p>Above now, far above them, rose the peaks
and pinnacles of this fairy-tale place. Below
them the whole island rose like a hand from the
sea, joined to the mainland by only the single
mile-long causeway. Ringed about the finger’s
root were the far off houses, fronting the sea,
backs to the land. And surmounting the whole,
like a thimble atop the finger, the abbey, rising,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
ever rising in the still clear air to the final peak
of all, the glittering image of Saint Michel de
la mer du peril; of the perilous sea. The Archangel,
it seemed, loved heights. From the tip
of the tower that crowned his abbey, wings of
gold outspread, sword uplifted, his mailed foot
crushed the devil who crawled beneath, and
atop one foot perched the golden cock, symbol
of eternal vigilance.</p>

<p>Cynthia, gazing skyward murmured,
“Lovely!”</p>

<p>“Marvelous!” whispered Nancy looking seaward.
The sands of St. Michel, those treacherous
sands through which the tide can rip and roar
in minutes, seconds almost, shone far below them
now, peacefully dry, almost lavender in the
sun, creating a false horizon for the fringe of
little houses along the shore.</p>

<p>“Let’s get a guide,” suggested Nancy turning
back. “I detest them as a rule. But this place
is a perfect labyrinth, and besides you can pick
up so much information the guide books don’t
give you.”</p>

<p>At the entrance gate, where a few francs
bought admittance, they found that a group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
would start through the abbey in about twenty
minutes. Preferring to wait outside they braced
themselves against the wall where the sun was
pleasantly warm and watched their fellow
tourists assemble.</p>

<p>A little old lady and her husband, both very
winded from the long climb. “From Ioway,”
Cynthia bet Nancy in a whisper. “And on their
wedding anniversary trip.”</p>

<p>“Heads you win, tails I lose,” said Nancy
scornfully. “But these are Britishers, I’ll bet
my new tube of Prussian blue.”</p>

<p>Sober hats set high on the head, bright complexions,
and, as they drew nearer up the stair,
broad A’s and clipped G’s proved Nancy to be
right. Next three French sisters in black and
white, from some religious order.</p>

<p>“Probably from a convent in Canada,” hazarded
Nancy, listening to their French. “They
come on holiday to visit the churches in France.
Mother and I have crossed with groups of them
several times; they are always so picturesque
and so jolly. And here’s a pretty girl for your
sketch book, Cyn.”</p>

<p>It was the girl from the restaurant, the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with the buttercup hair. And her young man.
The girl seemed to half recognize Cynthia, for
she gave a little tremulous smile, then turned
abruptly away as though she wasn’t sure whether
they had met or not.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mesdames et Messieurs</i> ...” began the guide
in shrill tones and, fumbling with an enormous
bunch of keys, unlocked the great door to the
abbey. For the next hour he led them through
cloisters twelve hundred feet above the ocean,
through the refectory and the ancient church,
through banqueting halls in which kings and
princes had feasted. “They say Harold the
Saxon was a guest and a prisoner here of William
of Normandy before William became the Conqueror,”
translated Nancy.</p>

<p>Beyond her the young man also translated for
the benefit of the girl with him. Between them
Cynthia managed to pick up most of the guide’s
information. They were in the banqueting hall,
that long gray drafty hall with its many pillars,
and Cynthia, gazing about her, tried to transform
it to the way it must have been when
Harold was the unwilling guest. A place of
flaring torches, lords and ladies in silks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
velvets, in trailing veils and sky-pointing hennins,
lifting their heavy trains from the rushes
that covered the floor. There would be tapestries,
rippling along the walls as the drafts
caught them, painted ceilings that had long ago
faded to gray and stone color, minstrels to make
music, great dogs to lie about on the rush-strewn
floor, and the delicious scent of long forgotten
foods from those great fireplaces in the kitchens
beyond. Yes, the far off times must have been
fun too. She wished she had been here then.</p>

<p>But the oubliettes changed her opinion on
that. Only a few of them, so the guide said,
now remained open to the public. The others,
cut down through the solid rock, lay far, far
below, damp, almost airless, foul with rats and
crawling things.</p>

<p>“And if the abbot or the king wanted you out
of the way, you lived for years down there,”
said Nancy.</p>

<p>One, not far below the dining hall, was a tiny
place, dark, airless, with scarcely room to lie or
sit or stand upright.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” asked Cynthia, “that
those people up above could dance and sing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
... and enjoy themselves with all those prisoners
down below them?”</p>

<p>The group had gone on a way; but Cynthia,
lingering behind to explore, had jumped down
into the oubliette to see just what kind of a place
it really was. She spoke from the floor, some
distance below Nancy’s neat brown oxfords.</p>

<p>Nancy shrugged. “That’s the middle ages,
darling.”</p>

<p>Cynthia reached up. “Give me a hand, Nancy.
I want to get out of here. Ugh ...” once on
the floor beside the other, “I hate this place, it’s
haunted by all those horrible things they used to
do.”</p>

<p>Nancy looked at her queerly. “Not see any
more? All right. I’m willing,” and five minutes
later they stood once more before the great
western entrance looking out over the sands and
the town below.</p>

<p>“Ou ... uf!” Cynthia drew a great breath
of the free air. “I’d go off my nut if we stayed
in there much longer. It’s beautiful, but gosh,
it was cruel. Let’s go somewhere and pick
daisies and get the smell of those forgetteries
out of our noses. C’mon, Nannie.” And grabbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Nancy’s wrist she hauled her headlong
down the stairs towards the town below.</p>

<p>As they raced past, Mrs. Brewster was still
absorbed in her cabbages and did not even look
up. The steps narrowed, they came to the block-long
village with its dark, tiny windowed houses
where were displayed all the usual tricks to
catch the tourist trade.</p>

<p>“Daisies!” cried Cynthia. “Where can we get
daisies?” and looked about her. Steep cobbled
streets, the sands ahead.</p>

<p>“Let’s stop and get us a citronade, and I’ll
ask,” suggested the diplomatic Nancy. While
they sipped the sweet warmish drink from thick
tumblers she chattered with the waitress. “It’s
all right,” she reported. “There are pretty
flowers for you to pick, my child. Oh, there’s
your blonde friend’s boy friend, and all alone.”</p>

<p>Cynthia had noticed him too, furiously striding
down the steep street. Where was the buttercup
girl? “They were quarreling last night,”
she said, watching the nervous wiry back as it
turned the lower corner of the street, entered the
hotel. “And then her father came in. She
didn’t seem very happy today either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
“Little Miss Fix-it,” teased Nancy. “What’s
it to you? Come on now, we’ll go hunt daisies.”</p>

<p>At the very foot of the street where, at high
tide the seas must wash, where boats lay,
small and deserted on the yellow sand, footprints
led along the base of the cliff. Here, rounding
the turn, the wind blew freshly from off the
coasts of England, small crabs scuttled to shelter
as they passed and far far above them Saint
Michel dominated his devil and the cock eternally
crowed.</p>

<p>Above them suddenly rose steep cliffs covered
with coarse grass, and, if not daisies, at least
their French cousins. No houses here, though
piles of rubble and a bit of crumbled wall told
that the abbey buildings must once have straggled
down the face of this cliff. Far above
small peasant children climbed and called, or
swung bare legs from an outcrop of rock, and
still higher a small hunched figure sat all alone
on a rock. Cynthia was about to say, “Oh, there’s
the little American,” but remembering what
Nancy had just called her, held her tongue and
busied herself with collecting a bouquet for Mrs.
Brewster’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Presently wearying of this she sat on a stone
to survey the steep climb she had already come
and the sands beyond that. It seemed to her that
the color of the sand had changed, darkened, in
the past ten minutes. Idly she noted that the
children had gone; already she could see them
scampering past the rock at the base, saw them
disappear. She looked back of her. Nothing
here, no connection with the town. To get home
one must go the way they had come. Just beyond
where Nancy was still picking flowers was
the American girl. Cynthia’s gaze took her in
with the rest of the scene. Suddenly she was
startled almost out of her wits by a small
figure that tore past her, yelling at the top of his
lungs.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and was still more
startled to see Nancy come pelting after the boy.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La marée ... la marée montante ...</i>”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Cynthia, gazing after
the small figure that had passed. A good model
that boy would be, with his wind blown curls,
his startled eyes.</p>

<p>Nancy grabbed her arm, shouted in her ear,
“Run ... <em>run</em> ...”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
“What ... why?” Cynthia’s feet pounded
after Nancy. Over her shoulder Nancy flung,
“‘The tide,’ he said. ‘The tide is rising.’”</p>

<p>Cynthia looked back. The girl behind them
had risen from her rock. With a wrench Cynthia
freed her arm from Nancy’s grasp, put
hands to mouth and megaphoned. “Hurry!
<em>Hurry!</em> The <em>tide!</em>”</p>

<p>She seemed to get the idea for immediately
she came leaping down over the rocks. Cynthia
paused only once to glance behind and see what
good speed the girl was making, then raced to
catch up with Nancy. Almost together the
three reached the sands.</p>

<p>So that was why they had changed so rapidly
from ochre to lavender. Water, tidal water,
seeping swiftly, menacingly from beneath,
pouring in from every side. But the sand at
the base of the rocks was still dry, it was hardly
five minutes race around the rocks to the end of
the little street. Hearts pounding, breath sobbing,
they reached it together.</p>

<p>Cynthia could not stop there. She wanted to
reach her hotel, her room, feel safe ground,
familiar ground that could not dissolve into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
seas beneath her feet, before she stopped. As
she tore through the hallway, passed the astonished
eyes of Madame at the desk, Nancy was
close behind. Together they dragged the little
American in with them, slumped together on
the two beds.</p>

<p>“Well!” gasped Cynthia.</p>

<p>“<em>Well!</em>” Nancy echoed her. “My good
gosh, Cynthia, that was a close call!” The
buttercup girl rose first, stood for a long moment
at the window looking out. “Look here ...”
she said at last, seemed to have trouble with her
voice and spoke again, “Come here, you two.”
It was the first they had heard her speak.</p>

<p>Cynthia who had by now slightly recovered
her breath, felt that her knees would bear her
again. But when she looked out she nearly lost
what breath she had gained.</p>

<p>“Nancy ... oh <em>Nancy!</em>”</p>

<p>From base of rock to farthest horizon the sea
rushed, tumbling, foaming, stealthily rising,
rising. Ten minutes later and they would have
been engulfed in it, even five minutes later and
the quicksands, forerunner of the rush of waves,
would have caught them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
“They say it rises sixteen feet every tide.”
Nancy’s voice was shaking.</p>

<p>The best thing that could have happened was
the entrance of Mrs. Brewster. Having heard
Madame’s story at the desk she immediately
took cheerful charge of the situation. “We’ll
have lunch here in the room,” she suggested.
“I’ll order anything you like, and then all three
of you had better lie down for an hour. This
is Miss ...?”</p>

<p>“Comstock, Betsey Comstock,” murmured
the buttercup girl.</p>

<p>Cynthia, endeavoring to follow Mrs. Brewster’s
cheerful lead, asked if the hotel couldn’t
serve some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escargots</i>, snails. She had heard they
were good, and she said she felt in a mood to experiment.
Actually not even snails for lunch
seem very reckless after their recent experience.
Betsey still seemed a little dazed but Nancy had
several wildly fantastic suggestions and Mrs.
Brewster rang for the waiter, ordered lunch to
be brought to their room.</p>

<p>They had scarcely sat down to eat when a
knock sounded imperatively on the door. As
Mrs. Brewster answered it Cynthia saw beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
her shoulder a man’s face, distraught and white.</p>

<p>“Oh, Madame,” he cried. “Is Miss ... I
was told ... that is. ...”</p>

<p>“Robert!” Betsey Comstock had rushed past
Mrs. Brewster, and flung herself into the young
man’s arms. Smiling, Mrs. Brewster discreetly
closed the door, but murmurs and soft voices as
though in reconciliation sounded beyond it.
The girls were half way through lunch when
Betsey, such a changed Betsey, all smiles and
radiance, reappeared.</p>

<p>“Apologies, please,” she begged charmingly.
“Robert had a luncheon engagement with a man
he met here at the hotel, an architect. So I did
not ask him in. But the rest, I’d like to explain.”</p>

<p>To Cynthia it sounded very romantic, a young
Basque, Yberri was the name, educated in America
for his career of architecture and Betsey,
now engaged to be married to him, with her own
career as a costume designer. What could be
nicer?</p>

<p>“Who do you work for?” asked the practical
Nancy. “Have you sold anything yet?”</p>

<p>“I had my first act in Cochran’s Revue, the
recent one, in London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
“Oh! Moms and I saw that. Did you see
the lovely ballet with the Chinese pagodas on
their heads?”</p>

<p>Betsey flushed a little and smiled. “That one
was mine. ...”</p>

<p>“Cynthia, she’s good,” Nancy turned enthusiastically
to the others. “The stuff was
swell. ...”</p>

<p>Betsey continued. They were to be married
next week, in Paris, and return to the States, Dad
and Robert and she. Betsey had letters of introduction
to two or three big theatrical producers
in New York and promise of further
work with Cochran.</p>

<p>“Grand!” applauded Nancy.</p>

<p>But the trouble, it seemed, was this: Robert
didn’t want his wife to continue her work after
they were married.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” murmured Cynthia. Just suppose
Chick didn’t want her to keep on with her
covers. But then Chick was an artist also; he
understood.</p>

<p>“Stop your painting?” asked Nancy, puzzled
to understand anyone in a family that didn’t
design or illustrate or paint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
“Oh no, he’s willing I should keep on with
the designing, but not willing I should earn
money with it.”</p>

<p>Which explained their quarrel at the table
last night, explained why Betsey had gone off
today by herself on the rocks.</p>

<p>“But now it’s all right, isn’t it?” asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>Betsey’s smile became somewhat less bright.
“No ... o,” she admitted. “We made it up,
the quarrel I mean. But nothing is decided,
nothing definite.”</p>

<p>“It’ll work out somehow,” consoled Cynthia.
“Just see if it doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Betsey of the buttercup hair was still on her
mind next morning. Nancy had volunteered to
go on a hunt for the small boy of the hill, the
one who had warned them of the tide. Cynthia
had an idea that he would make a good model
for her next magazine cover. She herself was
sharing the privilege of the cabbage patch and
the shade of the parapet with Mrs. Brewster,
both painting busily, when Betsey’s voice
sounded slightly above Cynthia’s right ear.</p>

<p>“’S good,” murmured the voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Cynthia looked up. “Hi!” she said, around
the paintbrush in her mouth, but her gaze wandered
back to the sunny ochre of the sands and
the blue-green of the cabbages. Difficult to depict
sunlight against that false horizon; you
need blue sky to make a landscape look sunny.</p>

<p>“I’m going up to the abbey,” whispered
Betsey with an eye on Mrs. Brewster busily
painting along the wall.</p>

<p>“Stop on the way back. And don’t fall into
any oubliette.” But after she had gone Cynthia
still worried about her. It was all mixed up
with the hue of cabbages in sunlight. Why was
Betsey alone, had they quarreled again? If that
Robert Yberri had any sense he’d let her keep
on with her work ... oh glory, <em>how</em> did you
get the color of that shadow! Cynthia took a
peek at Mrs. Brewster’s oil sketch, almost
groaned at the comparison, but mixed a tiny
drop of rose madder with her wash and cocked
her head on one side. Perhaps that was it!</p>

<p>An hour later she put the last touch on it,
yawned, stretched and looked up. Mrs. Brewster
had tactfully stolen away. Below the fortress
wall the sands were slowly darkening into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
lavender as they had yesterday and the shadow
of the wall no longer gave her shelter. Time
to pack up and go home.</p>

<p>But with her paints packed, her box strapped
neatly, she perched on the wall to watch again
that relentless tide. First the darkening of the
sand. One could not say at just what instant the
lavender began to gleam with moisture, at what
precise second one noted water seeping into this
hollow and that, at what tick of the watch the
hollows joined, ran into each other, became
larger, ran into a hundred thin, continuous
streams across the wide expanse of sand.</p>

<p>Someone was coming up the steps, a man with
thick brown hair uncovered, with American
plus fours.</p>

<p>“Miss Wanstead?” asked Betsey’s Robert.</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded, then glanced back at the
sands below, and gasped. Where an instant before
had been wet sand with a few thin streams
across it a dozen rushing rivers now flowed, joining
swiftly into a relentless, heaving sea.</p>

<p>“Frightening, isn’t it?” said Betsey’s Robert.
“We saw it rise like that two days ago. That’s
why I’m here. I know how dangerous it is and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
I want to thank you for bringing Betsey back
yesterday, you and Miss Brewster.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Cynthia. “It ... it
wasn’t anything.” Then she laughed. “I mean,
of course, it was a lot. Only she would have got
back. ...”</p>

<p>“She says she wouldn’t. Of course she could
have stayed there eight or nine hours.”</p>

<p>“Or you could have sent for her in a boat,”
suggested the more practical Cynthia.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m tremendously grateful.” He
sat down on the wall beside her. “Imposing,
isn’t it?” He gestured toward the great abbey
behind them. “One of the most imposing sites
in all the world, and combined with what man
has done to it, it’s stupendous. You’re an artist,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Cynthia admitted it. “And you too ...
and Betsey.”</p>

<p>“Betsey’s a smart kid.” And suddenly Cynthia
thought, “Why, he’s awfully in love with
her,” and liked him better, even if he were
as stubborn as a mule.</p>

<p>“Is she?” she asked aloud and ingenuously, so
that Robert had to brag a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“She’s worked for Cochran, you know; costumes,”
with quiet pride in the ability of his
fiancée.</p>

<p>“Marvelous. She must be good. Though
of course he takes lots of beginners, doesn’t he,
for a short tryout?” She knew nothing of
the kind, but spoke as one with inside information.</p>

<p>Robert flushed and set his jaw. “Not at all,”
he said stiffly. “Betsey’s good enough to keep on
with him, show after show. And to get work
in New York too, if she wishes.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Cynthia’s eyebrows expressed her
scepticism. “Only of course, once she’s married. ...
I mean no girl can really manage
two jobs, can she?”</p>

<p>She almost giggled at the way he took it.
“I ...” his mouth hung open a minute. But
stubborn people were contrary, too, and Robert
was no exception. “Well, after all, I expect to
keep on with architecture after I’m married.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, but a man ...” Cynthia’s air was
still one of polite incredulity. “Here’s Betsey
now.”</p>

<p>Buttercup hair windblown, cheeks very pink.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
“But my dear, you’ve been crying again,”
thought Cynthia and wondered if it wouldn’t be
tactful to withdraw immediately. Betsey herself
answered that.</p>

<p>“Finished your sketch, Cynthia? I’m so
glad you waited. I’ve got a telegram to show
you. ... I’m leaving tonight, if I can get
across to the mainland.” She was carefully
avoiding Robert’s eyes.</p>

<p>Betsey had a little pink slip in her hand. Cynthia
took it and read aloud, as well as she could,
the garbled English of the French wire. “Miss
Elizabeth Comstock. Hotel des Poissons ...
and so on. Please be in London Monday the
eleventh, my office. Stop. Wish to talk over
two scenes in new revue. Stop. Charles Cochran.”</p>

<p>So. Betsey had made her decision. What
would Betsey’s Robert say to that. Cynthia
looked up, was about to burst into congratulations
when the man forestalled her.</p>

<p>“Betsey! I’m so glad! But hadn’t we better
hurry? I’ve got to pack and you know how slow
I am. We’ll get your Dad to chaperon us as
far as London and get married there instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
in Paris. This Cochran thing is too grand a
chance to miss.”</p>

<p>Cynthia, viewing Betsey’s radiant astonishment,
thought almost smugly, “What price
Nancy’s little Miss Fix-it?”</p>

<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>The Basque Country</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">THE CUCKOO</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Nancy and Mrs. Brewster who had
suggested the Basque country. This was partly
because Cynthia needed a new type of child’s
head for her covers for <cite>Little One’s Magazine</cite>,
and partly because they thought it would be a
new and amusing adventure. It bore also the
extra recommendation of economy. Mrs.
Brewster had a friend in a tiny village, well off
the beaten track of tourists. He was an artist,
he would see that Cynthia found good accommodations,
if not in his own house, then in a
house nearby. Good, she would write to him,
find out for sure if he was still living. For he
was, she said, old, old.</p>

<p>The Basque country seemed, to Cynthia, a
very long way off from Paris, and from the
Brewsters in Brittany, and from all the places
she had grown to know. The scare and loneliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of Paris had been exorcised by her first
success with the portrait of Nono. No place
where you can earn a living can be, after you
have proved yourself, really strange or unfriendly.
But miles and miles away, in the
southwestern corner of France it might be different.</p>

<p>Somewhat reluctantly, feeling a little forlorn
and abandoned, Cynthia left the Brewsters in
Britanny and returned to Paris. France is a
great spider web of glittering rails of railways,
but Paris, like a giant, not unfriendly, spider,
sits in the heart, if not the exact center, and to
go almost anywhere it is cheaper and easier to
return to that city and start all over again.</p>

<p>An hour on the train, and the feeling of forlornness
began to disappear. Under Nancy’s
stern tutelage Cynthia’s French had improved
enormously. Now she knew how to order a
meal, where and how to buy her lunch, if there
was no dining car on the train; knew that she
must give up her ticket at the exit barrier, but
retain it until then, and half a hundred other
small things that went to make life and travel
smoother and more pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Going back to Paris was almost like going
home again. Her own little room up near the
roof in the Hotel St. Severin, or one very like it
except that the wallpaper sprawled magenta
fuschias on a green ground instead of huge coins
of blue and gold and purple on a red ground. A
dinner with Alice and the Murchisons, and a
pressing invitation to bring over her bags from
the hotel and stay with them as long as she
could. Then she encountered, of all people,
Stasia Carruthers, in front of the Café de la
Paix, and was carried off to Rumplemeier’s for
one of their scrumptious teas.</p>

<p>News was exchanged. Stasia had been down
to Switzerland, was back now for some fittings
and to buy some new hats. Gaily Cynthia
plunged into her own adventures, even to how
she had sold three portraits of children in the
little town of Le Conquet, once she had succeeded
in breaking down the reserve of the villagers.
For just a little while she found herself
envying Stasia; her new, smart little Paris hat,
her trick little silk suit, fresh from the scissors
of Chanel. Looking up suddenly she surprised
a strange expression in Stasia’s dark eyes. Could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
it be envy? Envy for the greater adventure of
earning your way. Anyone could buy his way
on a fat letter of credit. But to earn as you went,
that was the greater risk, hence the greater adventure.</p>

<p>Cynthia chuckled to herself, tucked a stray
curl beneath the brim of the hat she had bought
for fifty francs in the Rue St. Roch, and ceased
to envy Stasia.</p>

<p>Two days later, having restocked her box of
water colors on the Boulevard Montparnasse,
that parnassus of all good little art students, she
took train at some uncanny hour of the early
morning for Bordeaux. There, late in the afternoon
and from the shouting hotel runners at the
station, each screaming the particular merits of
his own hotel, she chose the Hotel de New York.
It seemed homelike as to name at least.</p>

<p>It proved dingy and down at heels, but with a
charming view out over one of Bordeaux’ countless
city squares. Cynthia yawned through her
dinner, left an early call for breakfast, and was
off again almost before daylight for Gotien, in
the Basses-Pyrénées. Three times that day she
changed trains, until, from sheer weariness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Gotien began to seem like some Never-never
land, always retreating as one advanced. And
beyond Gotien&mdash;the address she was bound for
was Mouleon-Soule.</p>

<p>She had gone through the gate with her suitcase
and sketch box and stood, almost shaking
with weariness full in the afternoon sun that
streamed across the dusty, cobblestoned plaza.
No one could tell her how to get to Mouleon-Soule.
But perhaps if she could find the station
hotel, get a good dinner and a night’s sleep, she
could grapple, tomorrow, with the problem.</p>

<p>Then from beyond the ragged plane trees that
lined the plaza came a little shabby, stoop-shouldered
man in a Basque beret timidly displaying
a wide, toothless smile. His English
savored quaintly of both French and American.</p>

<p>“Is it that this is the Mademoiselle Euanstead?”</p>

<p>Cynthia squinted against the sun. She was
too weary to think. Was someone to meet her
here?</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m Miss Wanstead.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon!</i> We had the letter from Madame
Brewster.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
“Oh, then you are Monsieur Marge. How
nice! I couldn’t discover a train for Mouleon.”</p>

<p>“No train,” he shook his head. “Only the
tramcars. But come and meet my wife.”</p>

<p>Madame was a plump little dumpling in plain
worn black, knitting on one of the benches beneath
the trees. She beamed a silent welcome
and carried her knitting with her, needles clicking
without a break, into the tram which had
been waiting, small town fashion, for Monsieur
Marge to find his guest. For an hour, while
Cynthia struggled to keep her eyes open, they
rattled and banged through clouds of dust
toward the tiny town of Mouleon, then out again
into open country.</p>

<p>Sunset had passed and it was nearly dark when
they reached their final stop and Cynthia stumbled
up the path behind her hosts. Twice, during
the simple dinner, she found herself nodding.
Then at some brief remark from
Madame, Monsieur Marge suggested kindly:</p>

<p>“My wife sees that you are very tired. I will
light the candle and show you to your room.”
Behind him a silly little cuckoo clock chirped
nine times, as Cynthia stumbled up the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Cynthia woke slowly, aware of an unusual
sound. Something, someone was snoring.
Surely&mdash;no, the sound couldn’t possibly be human.
She lay still a moment, listening, then
decided she really must investigate, and sat up
against her pillows.</p>

<p>She was in a high, story-book bed, such a bed
as might have accommodated the princess of
a Grimm fairy-tale. With four high posts,
heavy dark draperies sweeping the floor, and,
actually, three little steps of a ladder to lead up
to it. She leaned over and peered down at them,
then gave a delighted bounce. She had been too
sleepy the night before to notice those steps, but
she did remember her host’s very French warning
that the night air was dangerous and that she
must keep her windows tight closed. But after
Madame and Monsieur had departed she had
crossed to the casements and opened them wide.</p>

<p>Now she pattered, barefooted, down the steps
and leaned out over the low sill. The curious
snores came from just below. Grunts, not
snores! Oh, the darlings! Pigs, little ones, and
all ten of them very vocal and very hungry and
directly beneath her window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
“Well, I never thought I’d live over a pigpen,”
laughed Cynthia. “Isn’t that France for
you!”</p>

<p>At the end of the long room a dusty old mirror
in a tall gold frame reflected the polished parquet
floor with its dark oak inlay, the huge heavy
furniture, built to last many lifetimes, the two
high windows, and the Basque Pyrénées, towering,
blue, beyond the green of rolling fields. In
the center of it all Cynthia herself, like some
new kind of a blue-and-white striped, pyjamaed,
fairy-tale princess; dark hair a tangle of curls,
blue eyes wide and amused, bare pink toes pattering
over the shining floor.</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly are an anach ... anachronism
... or however you pronounce it
when you mean you’re out of place!” she twinkled
at the fairy in the mirror. “Wonder what
time they breakfast here! Gosh, I’m hungry!”</p>

<p>She tiptoed to the door. It swung silently on
well-oiled hinges. No footsteps sounded below
but there was a murmur of soft voices, the smell
of toast&mdash;she sniffed&mdash;and chocolate. Then
from somewhere in the house a bird call sounded.
Nine times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
A cuckoo clock. Nine cuckoos. My, but it
was late! Hurry and get dressed, my dear. She
scampered back to fling on her clothes. “Glory,
what a day!”</p>

<p>She must have slept twelve hours solid.
Goodness, how heavenly the pines smelled, how
wonderful this peace and quiet after the hot
asphalt, the ceaseless noise, the rattle and scream
of Paris.</p>

<p>She ran a comb through her hair, gave a dab
of powder to her nose and opened the door again.
The wide shallow stairs led directly into the sun-drenched
kitchen.</p>

<p>Madame, looking up, beamed good morning
from her work over the stove. “Bon jour, bon
jour,” and seemed very proud of even that much
French. Her own language was Basque, of
course.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mam’selle Euanstead. You
have slep’ well?”</p>

<p>“Gorgeously! Is this for me, Monsieur
Marge?”</p>

<p>A single place at the kitchen table was set
with a bowl of hot cocoa on a red checked napkin.
There was another napkin, a big spoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
crisp hot bread fresh toasted in the oven, and a
huge sweet orange.</p>

<p>“An egg also?” asked Monsieur Marge from
the doorstep where he sat with his pipe. “No?
Then when you have finished a second cup of
cocoa I shall show you my hive’ and my bee’ and
my studio.”</p>

<p>The latter proved to be a small, dingy, not
too well-lighted building behind the rambling,
whitewashed, red-roofed house. Here dusty
canvases and dried tubes of paint, bits of old
tapestry and ancient stretcher-frames were piled
and presided over by two of those artist’s lay
figures that resemble life-sized, wigless dolls.</p>

<p>Monsieur Marge turned over the quaint old
pictures to display them and Cynthia murmured
appreciation, trying hard to find something to
admire in each. But they were of such an ancient
manner, of the “brown gravy” school,
with shadows dead as brown paint and thick,
lifeless color, that proper applause was difficult.</p>

<p>“You know I paint in America too?” he asked
her proudly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Brewster told me. Where was
that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
“I live in Philadelphia fifteen years. That
was before the war. Then I live in South America
with my son, long time. Many Basque live
in South America. Then I come home here, to
my old farm I buy when I young man ...
many year ago. That was before you were
born.” He chuckled at his own age. “Long
ago I paint those panorama for the World Fair
in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! Did you? I’ve heard of them
but never saw one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. They be gre-e-a-t painting.”
He spread his arms to indicate an immense canvas.
“And figures modeled like life. I paint
twelve of those. They go all round the country.
Twelve Battle of Gettysburg, with men in uniform
in the wheat field. Battle of Gettysburg,
she was fought in a wheat field.” He chuckled
again and sucked on his empty pipe. “We work
all night, many night, on that to get her ready
for the opening of the Fair. We were all French,
the artists who work on her. But the day after
the opening we close the doors again, take her
down and paint again all night long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why?” cried Cynthia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“Because,” he grinned in cheerful toothlessness.
“We have paint <em>French</em> wheat field.
Full of puppies. American wheat field have no
puppies.” And he roared with laughter over
the ancient jest.</p>

<p>“Pup ...” for a moment Cynthia was puzzled.
Then she too laughed. “Oh yes, <em>poppies!</em>”
For all day yesterday she had admired the glorious
silky red flowers blooming among the wheat
beside the railway.</p>

<p>“You want to paint this morning?” And,
when Cynthia decided that she might as well
start immediately, “Go down the road and then
turn right, by the mill. That is near and pretty,
and tomorrow you can go further. You have
everything you want? Oil? Turpentine? Oh,
you paint in the water color. That is pretty,
too.”</p>

<p>So Cynthia settled down contentedly on the
old Basque farm. It was two miles through the
hot sunlight to the nearest village but she found
plenty to paint within easy walking distance of
the Marge house; nearby houses with their
Spanish iron balconies overhung with roses and
vines; the sturdy Basque farmers at work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
fields, and their great cream colored oxen that
paced so slowly along the road. The houses
were white with steep roofs and wide eaves of
deep gray and heavy shutters painted green, and
the vines, sprayed with arsenic green made rich
shadow patterns on the old walls. Then she
found an old stone church with the three-peaked
tower so characteristic of Basque village
churches and beneath its porch an iron grill to
discourage the pigs from entering the place of
worship. She peeped through the stone doorways
where the lintels bore blurred dates of the
early seventeenth century, to peer into the dim,
dark timbered kitchens on whose table-high
hearthstones a tiny fire of twigs burned beneath
the black kettle on a crane. With many of the
women she had a pleasant nodding and smiling
acquaintance, but she spoke no word of their
language and found that her French was not
understood. Besides, these people seemed unusually
reserved. She could establish no contact
with them.</p>

<p>Cynthia began to suspect that Monsieur
Marge was in a similar position and was very
lonely because of it. He had lived so long in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
America that he had lost touch with these, his
own people, and when he had returned to them
found that they considered him a foreigner. He
was now neither Basque nor American.</p>

<p>It was a valley of enchantment hidden between
the high snow capped peaks of the Pyrénées.
Each day was as clear-skied, as sunny and
warm as the one before it and Cynthia woke each
morning in her fairytale bed to look forward to
another bright morning of painting, another
sleepy afternoon of sketching. Still, she reminded
herself after a week of this, she wasn’t
getting any further with her job for the month.
She had come down here to do a Basque cover for
the <cite>Little Ones’ Magazine</cite>. Somewhere she
must find herself a model.</p>

<p>Her second week in the Basque country had
started. Monday slipped by, Tuesday evening
she sat, as usual on the doorstep after a late
dinner. Monsieur Marge smoked placidly, Madame
knitted in the half dark of the vine-hung
verandah. There was a sound of cattle bells far
down the smooth winding road and the mountains
leaned, purple dark, against the sunset.</p>

<p>Cynthia and the old man had been comparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
their memories of old songs. Astonishing how
many of the old ones, the really old ones that belonged
to mother’s, even to grandmother’s day,
he remembered from his years in America.
There was “Sweet Marie” and “Sweet Rosey
O’Grady,” and “Sidewalks of New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, they sing that still,” cried Cynthia
and whistled it with him. Madame hummed
and smiled placidly while her fingers seemed to
twinkle in time to the gay little tune.</p>

<p>“A Bicycle Built for Two,” he suggested.</p>

<p>Yes, Cynthia knew that one. She had heard
it in the movies. A moment of silence then,
while they paused to think of more, and from
the dark room behind them came a cheerful
“Cuck ... oo. Cuckoo ...!”</p>

<p>“What makes the bird in the clock cuckoo?”
asked Cynthia when she had finished counting
nine warbles.</p>

<p>“Wait, I show you.” Monsieur sprang to his
feet and disappeared into the kitchen, to return
a moment later with the clock beneath his arm.</p>

<p>Madame gave a little chuckle and Monsieur
explained. “We bought this on our wedding
trip, in Switzerland, almost fifty years ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
He set it down on the step and returned for a
lamp, which he lighted and placed beside the
clock. Then, with delicate fingers he removed
the screws in the back and exposed the carved
wooden works for Cynthia to see. Unlike the
usual cuckoo-clock this was all self-contained,
without the long pendulum and the heavy iron
weights that usually hang down below the little
box. Its face and the surrounding frame was
like old lace, interwoven with tiny intricate
figures and small deer and cows and squirrels,
the whole dark with age and good French furniture
polish.</p>

<p>“See,” explained the old man. “There are
two little b’lows, here, and here,” and his finger
indicated the tiny bellows of leather, like those
used to blow a fire, “Now watch. I make him
sing.”</p>

<p>He turned the white hands to ten o’clock,
and the cuckoo popped out, opened his little red
mouth and warbled. One small bellow went
<em>Cu ... ck</em>, and the other, immediately afterwards,
went <em>ooooo. Cuck ... oo. Cuck ... oo!</em>
Over and over. Ten times.</p>

<p>“Oh, I never knew what made him do it,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
cried Cynthia. “Now let me try.” The bird
popped out in such a quaintly serious fashion
that one wanted to laugh every time he appeared.</p>

<p>“I will keep him here and oil him in the
morning,” decided Monsieur Marge. “Perhaps,
in the night, he will attract other cuckoos,
yes?” Madame chuckled.</p>

<p>“Does she understand English?” asked Cynthia,
getting up to put the clock on the verandah
table.</p>

<p>“I un’ stand,” murmured Madame, in the
darkness and her husband shook his head. “Only
little. But she too lazy to speak anything but
Basque. We are conservative peepul, we Basque.
Per’aps it is as well. Otherwise we could not remain
so entrench’ against the centuries of invaders,
and of change.” And as the night
deepened and the stars came out Cynthia heard
old tales of Charlemagne and of his blond barbarians
from the north who had been defeated
in these very hills. Of how the Basque had
dwelt here for hundreds, perhaps even thousands,
of years, unconquered, unchanging.</p>

<p>“It may be because our language is so difficul’,”
explained the old man with pride. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
have a saying that the Devil once came here, to
our country and stayed seven years. In that time
he learn but two words. ... “By” for “Yes,”
and “Es,” for “No.” At las’ disgusted by his
waste of time, he flew away again, and soon forgot
even those two. That is why the evil never
comes here.”</p>

<p>He sighed in the darkness and Cynthia felt a
pang of pity. Even here, among his own people,
he was homesick, denied a closer contact with
them because of his long years in America.</p>

<p>The next morning Cynthia unfolded the
camp stool, on which she sat to sketch, beneath
the vines at the side of the farmhouse. A stone-paved
walk ran back to the little ramshackle
studio and M. Marge pottered about in the sunlight
with his beehives. Cynthia opened her
sketch book, squeezed color onto her palette and
set to work.</p>

<p>The cuckoo clock behind her ticked steadily
with no relation to the hour of the day. Cynthia,
rapidly sketching in the grape arbor and
the green door in the white wall beyond it, wondered
how to get the effect of spattered sunlight
where the light dribbled down through leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and discovered with a little thrill that part of the
trick lay in breaking the color, patting it on in
little spats of the brush with flecks of white
paper showing between, part in letting the
shadow actually dribble off her brush so that it
was lightest farthest from the leaves.</p>

<p>A small, cooing voice sounded behind her.
Turning, she saw on the path, a little girl of six
or maybe less, very Basque in her bright blouse
and dark blue cotton skirt and bare brown feet
thrust into rope soled espadrilles. Her eyes were
soft and brown and her hair had been plaited
into two pigtails, so tight that they seemed actually
to drag her eyelids upwards at the corners.</p>

<p>“Oh, you duck!” breathed Cynthia. “What
fun if I could paint you!”</p>

<p>The brown eyes danced with mischief, and
the small mouth was puckered into a demure
rosebud. What could have drawn her up the
path from the road? Cynthia’s glance followed
the child’s. The tick of the clock? But surely
she had heard a clock before. Then Cynthia
remembered that a moment before it had erratically
struck eleven. Laughing, she gestured a
query towards the clock. Was that it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
The small one nodded shyly.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll show it to you,” Cynthia offered.
“Want to see the birdie, do you?” She put down
book and brushes and led the way up the steps.
Then she turned the hands gently as she had
seen M. Marge do the night before. The bird
answered with a startled “Cuck ... oo!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The brown eyes danced with delight,
the small hands clapped <em>ecstatically</em>. The child
came closer.</p>

<p>“Now the next will be twelve,” Cynthia said,
though of course that wouldn’t mean anything
to this infant, and turned the hands again. This
time the bird gave a most satisfactory performance.
By the time his song was finished the
child’s face was so close to the little flapping
doors that Cynthia was afraid she would pop inside,
out of sheer rapturous delight.</p>

<p>“If I could get her, just so, with her head
turned like that, and those quaint little pigtails,
and the sunlight behind her&mdash;but I’m afraid
I’m not clever enough,” mourned Cynthia.
<a name="no" id="no"></a><ins title="Original has 'No'">“No</ins>;
it’s impossible.” Then to the child, “Birdie’s
all gone, my dear. No more today. I refuse to
ruin M. Marge’s wedding present just because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
a Basque baby wants to hear the cuckoo clock.
Sit down won’t you, and amuse me while I
work.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Marge came up the walk from his
beehives. He said something in Basque to the
child, who answered stammeringly. “She
should not be here,” he explained. “She lives
down there, the Yturbe house. She is the only
one left. The two sons died in the war, and this
is the only grandchild. The old people worship
her. I will take her home.”</p>

<p>Cynthia was sorry to see her go. “I wish I
could paint her,” she thought again wistfully,
but she knew M. Marge was not on good enough
terms with his neighbors to make the unusual
request. This was not Paris, where everyone
knew about artists and where models seem to
drop ripe from every lamp-post, blossom in
every <em>zinc</em> with your breakfast cocoa.</p>

<p>That afternoon a hive of bees swarmed and
M. Marge was so busy with them that the little
cuckoo clock waited another night unoiled, upon
the verandah. “I’ll do the job tomorrow and
put it back in the morning,” he promised Madame.
“It is quite safe there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
But apparently it wasn’t so safe. At least
when Cynthia came down to breakfast M.
Marge reported the clock was gone.</p>

<p>“Gone? ... The cuckoo clock?” Cynthia
heard herself repeating idiotically. “Well!
but goodness! Who on earth would take it?”</p>

<p>M. Marge shook his head and Madame, pouring
the morning chocolate, murmured something
in Basque.</p>

<p>“She says she is sorry to lose our wedding
present.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, I feel terribly responsible,”
mourned Cynthia. “If I only hadn’t asked you
to bring it out and show me.”</p>

<p>“It is my own fault.” The old man became
firmly cheerful. “Mais non, Mademoiselle, I
am a careless old man. I should not have left
the clock on the verandah. But the Basque are
honest peepul. We do not steal and we are too
far from the town for gypsies or tramps. I cannot
figure it out.”</p>

<p>Cynthia painted that morning with a
wretched feeling of responsibility. “I could get
them a new clock,” she told herself, “but it
wouldn’t be the same.” She had chosen a spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
down the main road, where two small stone,
white-washed houses, overgrown with rambling
roses, were as theatrically picturesque as a scene
from the Follies. But the sketch was not very
satisfactory. “It’s not my kind of thing,” she
fretted. “It’s fun to do, but I’d rather paint
people. Wonder where my little friend of yesterday
is. She must live in one of those
houses. ...”</p>

<p>A team of oxen plodded slowly down the
dusty road, brilliantly golden beneath the
shadow of the blue dyed sheepskin that lay atop
their heavy yoke, their eyes hidden behind a
heavy fringe of bright colored net. Their driver
walked ahead, his <em>makhila</em> over his shoulder
rested on the yoke to guide the animals.</p>

<p>Cynthia listened to the soft jangle of bells
till it died in the distance, then decided she was
hungry; that was what must be wrong with her
sketch, and packed up her materials. The
Marges never ate lunch. Cynthia had discovered
that a continental breakfast did not sustain
one very well from eight <small>A.M.</small> till five in the
afternoon, and after two days of semi-starvation
had persuaded Madame to give her a cold meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
at noon. Today there was sliced duckling and
a pleasant salad set on the red checked table
cloth beneath the sun spangled arbor.</p>

<p>She finished her raspberries, with the thick
pat of rich sour cream and the crust of warm
bread and idly watched M. Marge talking to
someone beyond the beehives. It looked like
the old man in the Yturbe household, Thomasina’s
grandfather. Cynthia wondered at that,
for she knew the two men were not close
friends. “I wish I could get that child to paint,”
she thought idly, remembering the small eager
face of the day before.</p>

<p>M. Marge came slowly and alone up the stone
flagged walk and sat down on the step beside
Cynthia’s luncheon table.</p>

<p>“There must be gypsies here,” he stated,
“For Thomasina has been stolen.”</p>

<p>“Thomasina!” cried Cynthia, aghast. “How
perfectly dreadful!” and felt her throat tighten.
For a moment she could not speak for fear of
bursting into tears. Little Thomasina! “When
... how long?” she asked after a moment.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not stolen ... perhaps. ... But
she has been gone since early this morning. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
is two now. She did not come home for her
noon meal. Her grandfather came to ask if we
had seen her. She has never gone from the dooryard
before, not until yesterday when she came
here. Her father thinks she may have strayed
down the road and met someone; she was very
unhappy over a little thrush they had, which
died. She may have been looking for him.”</p>

<p>Cynthia knew those little thrushes in their
willow cages which hung outside so many
French doorways.</p>

<p>“They are afraid of the canal, and the mill-pond.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but surely ...” Cynthia shivered
and was silent. No, nothing like that could happen
to someone that one knew! Absently she
pushed away the last of her raspberries. They
were her favorite fruit but she had lost any appetite
for them.</p>

<p>“Painting this afternoon?” asked her host,
trying to be cheerful.</p>

<p>Yes, Cynthia had thought she’d take the tram
into the tiny village and sketch the interior of
the old ruined fort, with the remains of the
sally-port and guardhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Monsieur Marge surveyed the sky, unflinchingly
blue. “Too hot to go into town,” he commented.
“Why not stay and we go hunt for
mushrooms. Madame wishes some for the
dinner tonight. I know deep woods, cool, where
the sun does not strike.”</p>

<p>City-bred Cynthia had never gathered mushrooms;
it sounded like a new and amusing experience,
and it would certainly be cooler than
sketching on that hot and sunny hill beyond the
town. Besides she didn’t really want to go far
from the house, in case little Thomasina should
be found ... no, <em>when</em> she should be found.</p>

<p>Cynthia went to her room for a wide shade
hat and came downstairs again to find M. Marge
ready for her. He bore a leather bound <em>makhila</em>,
the Basque walking stick, with its graven brass
binding and leather strap.</p>

<p>“Won’t we need a basket or something?”</p>

<p>“No. I show you.”</p>

<p>The method, it seemed, was to string the
fungus on a long thin peeled rod. They were
big things, flabby and pale lavender, rather like
unpleasantly raw liver, but Monsieur assured
her they were delicious when cooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
They had found the grove about two miles
from the house up an old logging road now
nearly overgrown with brush and deep damp
moss. The pines rose huge and straight and the
air was cool, but after an hour or more of scrabbling
over dead logs and grubbing among fallen
leaves for the mushrooms Cynthia was glad to
sink wearily to a seat on a mossy stone.</p>

<p>“<em>Ouff</em> but I’m weary. Goodness, how you
can walk!” she exclaimed to the pleased old
man.</p>

<p>“I have been hard worker in my time.”</p>

<p>“There’s a funny noise about here,” Cynthia
commented after a moment of silence. “Sounds
rather like a cricket, yet not. ... I wonder. ...”
She listened again and as the old man
started to speak held up her hand for silence.
There was no breeze. The pine boughs high
overhead scarcely moved. There were certainly
no crickets about, yet what was that noise?</p>

<p>Then from a thicket just a few yards away
came a familiar call. “Cuck ... oo! Cuck ...
ooooo!”</p>

<p>“Your clock!” Cynthia almost shouted, and
jumped to her feet. Monsieur Marge was right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
behind her as she parted the brush, looked downward.
She chuckled and held back the branch
that he might see.</p>

<p>There, wrapped in an old shawl and fast
asleep was Thomasina Yturbe. In her arms, its
placid little face turned to the skies, ticked the
imperturbable cuckoo clock.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve found one kidnapper at least,”
laughed Cynthia somewhat shakily. “Shall we
wake her up?” Poor little thing, she had come
a long way in this heat and the clock was quite
a weight for those small arms.</p>

<p>“It is too far to carry her home,” advised
the old man.</p>

<p>The child stirred at his voice, opened one
sleepy eye. Her face was pink as a seashell
from the rough warmth of the old shawl beneath
her. For a moment she blinked like a
little owl, then recognized them and beamed,
murmuring something. Monsieur chuckled
and repeated it for Cynthia’s benefit.</p>

<p>“She said the bird wouldn’t sing.”</p>

<p>“Come on honey. Time to go home.” Cynthia’s
words might not have been understood,
but her brightly matter of fact tone was sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Thomasina scrambled to her feet. “Here,
better let me take the clock. No? All right.
But let me carry the shawl, anyway. I wonder
why she brought the shawl?” she puzzled.</p>

<p>Monsieur had the suggestion that it had been
one thrown over the thrush’s cage at night.</p>

<p>“Poor kid,” murmured Cynthia.</p>

<p>It was a long journey back. Monsieur had
the two long sticks of mushrooms. Cynthia,
toward the last, was so far trusted as to be allowed
the clock but Thomasina kept one hand in
Cynthia’s. One was to understand that she was
not weary, but she wanted closer contact with
her little bird. The clock itself ticked steadily
throughout the journey and twice it even cuckooed.</p>

<p>It was late and the sun was low, throwing
long shadows across the road as they came down
it towards the Yturbe farm. Cynthia heard
the soft cooing of doves, the grunt of the little
pigs that lived beneath her window. Thomasina
stumbled once or twice.</p>

<p>They neared the doorway with its seventeenth
century date on the lintel. Someone inside was
sobbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
“I won’t go with you.” Cynthia pushed the
child forward and nodded that Monsieur Marge
was to follow her. This might be&mdash;who could
tell?&mdash;just the right moment for him to become
a Basque again.</p>

<p>Thomasina, the clock again in her arms,
stumbled through the doorway. Cynthia heard
nothing for a moment, then such a heartfelt cry
of delight and joy as made her, for the second
time that day, brush away the tears. Followed,
in three voices, much talk in the rapid Basque
tongue, and after a moment Grandmother
Yturbe came out, to throw her arms about the
petite Americaine.</p>

<p>“She says,” twinkled Monsieur behind her,
“that you are wonderful, that you found her
little cabbage.”</p>

<p>“Non&mdash;non. It was Monsieur,” Cynthia
gestured towards her host. “It’s all right anyway,
Thomasina would have come home for
dinner,” protested the embarrassed Cynthia.</p>

<p>They got away at last, but there was more to
come.</p>

<p>After dinner Cynthia and Madame were sitting
beneath the vines. Madame’s fingers flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
steadily as her needles ate up the gray yarn, and
moonlight bright as day dripped through the
dark leaves of the arbor. Someone came slowly
up the stone walk and spoke in Basque. It was
Thomasina’s grandfather.</p>

<p>“He has come to thank the American lady,”
explained M. Marge after a moment’s conversation
and added that he had told M. Yturbe that
Thomasina was to keep the clock for herself.
“After all, we have no grandchildren ourselves.”
And a moment later he translated again, “He
asks if the American lady will do him a portrait
of his little one; he will of course be proud to
pay for it.”</p>

<p>“I’d adore it,” cried Cynthia, “Oh, what a
day!”</p>

<p>The men moved off together, talking. Cynthia
saw them cross the road slowly, two old
men together.</p>

<p>Madame, chuckling richly, made one of her
rare remarks in English: “They not be back
till late.” But she seemed more pleased than
concerned.</p>

<p>“I guess that means M. Marge has become
all Basque at last,” thought Cynthia sleepily.</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Carcassonne</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">ROMANCE IN CARCASSONNE</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> had long ago learned how to say in
French “Stand still. Turn a little to the right
... to the left. Raise the chin please.” And
finally and most urgent, again “stand still!”
One needed these phrases constantly in the one
language the model understood. She had had
occasion to use them all, and more besides, this
afternoon, for the ragged little urchin, posing
against a background of old stone house and
carved fourteenth century doorway, was an imp,
though a delightful one, and had far too large a
circle of friends vitally interested in what he
was doing. Cynthia glanced up from her painting
and for the twentieth time in ten minutes
sighed in exasperation.</p>

<p>Every small child’s head, including of course
the model’s, had turned to watch the small group
crossing the square. It was just the usual collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of American tourists; every child in the city
must have seen their like hundreds of times,
herded by the Carcassonne guide&mdash;an old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mutilé</i>
of the Great War. Cynthia herself had twice
been round the wonderful old walls with him,
so she knew quite well what the others were
about to hear; of the ancient old towers, fifty
of them, and the ramparts dating back and back
to the tenth century, the foundations older even
than that, for the Romans had held a fortress
here; of the lovely little cathedral of Saint
Nazaire, set like a jewel in the heart of the town;
all these and more would the visiting Americans
see. The small model and his friends must
know by heart every syllable of the guide’s lecture,
every stone of the city by now. So why
need they turn, like a group of little monkeys,
just because someone had crossed the square!</p>

<p>“Oh <em>do</em> sit still!” she muttered crossly in
French.</p>

<p>The sketch was a good one, the best she had
made this week. Now if she could get just the
right hue of the shadow on his shoulder. ...</p>

<p>For several minutes the shadow and the mixing
of it from her color box held her absorbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Then an undue amount of chatter, even for a
group of small French boys watching an American
lady who made the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peinture</i>, caused her to
glance up again. One of the American tourists
had let the group go on without her and had
come across to stand behind Cynthia. She was
a tall girl, pretty, though pale, with big black
eyes and curly dark lashes and a smart American
traveling suit of blue and white wash silk. In
a low tone she was chatting with the children
and with such amazing ease and flourish of idiom
that Cynthia, with a pang of envy thought;
Canadian ... or Louisiana bred. She’s
grown up with the language. Oh darn that
<a name="model" id="model"></a><ins title="Original has 'model!”'">model!</ins></p>

<p>“Look here,” she turned to address the visitor.
“I wish you’d tell this little devil that I
won’t pay him the two francs I’d promised him
unless he sits still for ten more minutes. Then
he can go. My vocabulary simply won’t stand
the strain of putting that forcefully.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. She had a nice laugh
thought Cynthia still slightly resentful of the
interruption, then followed a stream of fluent
French addressed to the model.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
“Mind if I watch?” she asked quietly, and
Cynthia, again intent on the color of that
shadow, muttered an absent-minded permission.
Thereafter for the space of ten minutes
there was peace.</p>

<p>Along the old walls of Carcassonne, swimming
in the golden haze of afternoon light,
pigeons circled and cooed. From a not too distant
watch tower came the nasal drone of the
guide, explaining how, just here, the Black
Prince had stormed the city and burned the
tower. The air smelt of hot dust, sleepiness, and
France, and Cynthia’s busy brush flew from palette
to sketch and back again.</p>

<p>Finally, she leaned back on her stool, squinted
at the sketch with her head on one side, then
looked up and nodded. “It’s finished I guess.
I don’t know what you said to him, but it worked
like a charm. Sorry I was rude.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t rude. That’s a lovely painting,
and a good likeness too. You’re American
aren’t you? My name is Serena Grayson, from
New Orleans.” Only she said “O’lean” in the
prettiest manner imaginable.</p>

<p>“I guessed it,” grinned Cynthia. “Staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
in the Lower Town? Wait till I pay off this
infant and we’ll walk down together.”</p>

<p>“I should wait for Aunt Anna,” the girl hesitated.
“Look here, let me have a piece of paper
from your sketch book, will you? I’ll just scribble
a note to tell her that I’ve gone on. She is
shopping in the Cité, and started me out with
that guide.” Serena made a little face of dislike.
“I thought watching you would be more
fun, so I deserted, but she’ll be looking for me
when the tour is finished.”</p>

<p>Cynthia didn’t say anything but she thought it
was strange that a girl, fully her own age, should
have to report so carefully on where she was
going. Serena dispatched the note by one of the
small urchins who still lingered to watch the
fascinating process of packing up the paint box.
Almost any of them was eager to earn an extra
franc. “Though I hope it gets delivered,” remarked
Serena, watching the small boy dubiously
as he scampered off, “perhaps I hadn’t
better go, after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come along. It’s just to the Lower Town.
Nothing can hurt you and surely your Aunt
won’t care. Why I go all over France alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
“Do you?” almost wistfully.</p>

<p>The way out of the ancient walled city led
down a steep little cobbled street where houses
leaned their heads together, like gossips over tea
cups, and between whose stones grasses grew and
the shadows of the late afternoon flung a welcome
coolness. Then out past the tourney court
where once gallant knights in full armor had
fought for their ladies’ favor, and past the
Porte d’Aude, which looked out over the lower
and newer ... and uglier town.</p>

<p>“Where are you staying?” asked Cynthia.
“Glory, but it’s good to talk to an American
again! It’s been weeks since I have been able
to.” She hadn’t quite been aware how much
she had missed Nancy; had wished that Chick
were here until she met someone from home.</p>

<p>“It is jolly to speak your own tongue again.
We’re staying at the Chat d’Or, Aunt Anna and
myself. We only got here today. And won’t
you come and have dinner with us tonight? I’d
love to have you.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to come. I’ve been here nearly a
week now, and it’s worth every minute you can
spend here too. Look!” and Cynthia clutched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the other’s arm to turn her attention behind
them.</p>

<p>Above the road they had descended, full in
the glow of the late sun the city rose, golden
pale against the southern sky; turrets and
towers, battlements and barbicans, dreaming in
the fairy-tale light exactly as they had dreamed
for the past six hundred years and more.</p>

<p>“Lovely!” murmured the other, starry eyed.
For just a moment Cynthia thought there were
tears in her eyes, as well as stars, but she could
understand that. Cynthia herself often felt
teary when something was too beautiful to believe.</p>

<p>They took up this matter of dinner again.
“It will be nice to eat somewhere else, neither
of the two places I’ve tried are very good and
I’m sick of the boiled veal and caramel
<a name="custard" id="custard"></a><ins title="Original has 'custard, at'">custard
at</ins> the Cheval Blanc,” said Cynthia. “And
where the French ever got the idea they were a
nation of born cooks! ... I know where your
hotel is, suppose I run home now, my road goes
this way and yours to the left, then I’ll get a bath
and into a clean dress and be at your place ...
when? About seven?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
There were three hotels in Carcassonne, one
in the upper Cité, very grand and quaint, and
with the grandest, quaintest prices too, and two
in the lower town across the river Aude. Cynthia
had taken a room at the station hotel, which
was the first one she saw when she got off the
train. It was at least cheap and convenient. Oh
yes, and there was the Hotel de l’Universe,
hardly worthy of the name of a hotel but displaying
its grandiloquent appellation in gilt
letters two feet high across its entire three room
frontage. Cynthia had smiled at the name, for
she had found in France that it was generally
the smallest places that bore the biggest names.</p>

<p>The Universe looked cozy and very clean, and
she had even thought of moving her suitcase
inside its hospitable blue door, but had been too
busy to carry out the thought. Often however
she dined there and tonight as she crossed the
square and passed the little red checked gingham
curtains and the green painted iron tables on the
terrace, she saw the American boy having a beer
on the terrace, just as she had seen him every
evening since she came. She smiled and waved
a hand at him, and he very nearly smiled in return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Cynthia had an impulse to try once more
to talk to him, as she had tried on the train, but
immediately his gaze had returned morosely to
the long lane of dusty plane trees that lined the
street. Oh well, she wasn’t going to waste her
time picking up someone who evidently didn’t
want to be picked up. But when you travel for
miles and miles, and hours and hours in the
same railway coach with a chap, and you know
he’s a fellow countryman, and hard up probably,
like you are ... just look at the clothes
he wore; neat, but not any product of Park
Avenue, and when there’s scarcely another
American in the Lower Town, not at least until
today, why it would seem sort of pleasant to
meet once or twice and have a talk. Cynthia
gave a little skip of pleasure and forgot the
boy on the terrace. Nice to have a dinner
date, nice to be going to talk good old United
States for an evening. Adventure was exciting
... afterwards, but it was pretty dull sometimes
while it was happening.</p>

<p>But when she returned along the narrow little
street, past the <a name="Hotel" id="Hotel"></a><ins title="Original has 'hotel'">Hotel</ins> de l’Universe, with the last
rays of the sun gilding the far off towers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
upper city, the boy was still sitting on the terrace.
Cynthia wondered.</p>

<p>She had first seen him at Toulouse, standing
on the platform with his suitcase in his hand
and Cynthia, leaning out of the window to buy
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sandwich jambon</i> and a bottle of mineral
water from the little pushcart, like a giant
baby carriage, that peddles lunches on all the
train platforms in France, noticed his very
American shoes. She always played little games
with herself to ward off boredom, and by
this time considered herself quite skillful in telling
even Norwegians from English, who looked
so much like them.</p>

<p>This boy had ascended further down on the
corridor train. Cynthia was riding second class
instead of third for it was a long trip from the
Pyrenees to Carcassonne. Later in the afternoon
she noticed him in the very next compartment,
and still later passed him in the corridor, leaning
listlessly against the long window. The last
time before Carcassonne she noticed him on the
platform of a tiny way-station where he stopped
to buy a flower from a little girl and for the first
time, he smiled. Cynthia was startled at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
smile, so white and sudden and flashing. “Why,
he doesn’t look cross and unhappy at all!” she
thought. “Somebody ought to tell him to smile
more often!”</p>

<p>But she hadn’t seen him smile again in all the
weeks since then.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It might have been a very happy evening, but
for Miss Comstock, Serena’s Aunt Anna. She
was a pretty, plump little Southerner, carefully
rouged and powdered and manicured, exquisitely
dressed, with manners as sleek as the fur
of a well tended cat. But her manners didn’t
somehow put you at your ease, they just made
you feel crude and ill bred by contrast. Miss
Comstock’s slow drawl, even more pronouncedly
of the south than Serena’s, was as purring as a
kitten’s song of content, and she appeared to be
intensely interested in all her guest had been
and done and seen.</p>

<p>The hotel was much more pretentious than
Cynthia’s humble Cheval Blanc, with corridors
choked with palm trees and hanging baskets;
with delicious food; and with a great yellow
cat on the front mat attesting to the excellence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of the cuisine. Cynthia thought the cat’s smug
countenance bore a fantastic resemblance to
Serena’s Aunt Anna, but she wouldn’t have
trusted him alone with a canary.</p>

<p>“How wonderful to be an artist, wonderful
to do as you like with your life, no cares, no responsibilities,
no ties!” gushed Aunt Anna over
their coffee on the terrace.</p>

<p>Cynthia rudely thought “Oh yeah,” and remembered
the cover she must send back to the
States every month and all the other work she
had accomplished in Europe, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“You know I always had a fancy to be an
artist. But once I had an artist in love with me,”
and she sighed romantically.</p>

<p>“Lots of people in love with you, Auntie,”
murmured Serena, in so dutiful a tone that Cynthia
wondered how many hundred times she had
made the same remark.</p>

<p>Someone was playing a violin in the café
across the street, the lights and the sound of
voices streamed out across the little square beyond
the hotel terrace and a big yellow moon
swam up behind the plane trees. The streets
were full of people coming and going, for tonight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
was Saturday when all the town felt free
to play.</p>

<p>Serena had gone very silent since her last remark
and Cynthia, in spite of the beauty of the
hour, was beginning to feel sleepy and finding
it difficult to stifle her yawns as she watched the
shadow silhouettes of people passing, dark
against the café lights. It was like a scene in a
play. Some of the characters she already recognized
from her week in the town. There was
good old Madame Brassard, who kept the pastry
shop down by the river, leaning plumply on the
arm of her thin, gray little husband, and both
in spotless black as befitted a gala Saturday night.
And there was the guide from the Carcassonne
walls, limping on his cane, his face as blankly
sweet as a chromo portrait. It had been, Cynthia
knew, almost entirely shot away at Amiens,
and repaired again by a surgeon who had almost,
but not quite repeated the charm of the original.
And there was the boy from the other terrace,
slouching slowly, hands in pockets, shoulders
hunched disconsolately. Some day, perhaps tomorrow
morning, she would certainly cross the
street and start talking to him. ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Aunt Anna gave a faint exclamation and
leaned forward, blinking against the lights,
“Oh, isn’t that ... but no, of course not, how
foolish of me!” She gave a nervous little laugh.
“I ... excuse me, I thought I recognized someone
from home,” she said, and began to tell Cynthia
all about the nice man in the shop in the Upper
Town who was keeping a lovely silk shawl
till she <a name="came" id="came"></a><ins title="Original has come">came</ins> in to look at it again in the morning.</p>

<p>Serena, sitting with her back to the light, was
still silent. Cynthia suddenly jumped to her
feet and exclaimed. “Come on, let’s go for a
walk up to the walls. It’s a wonderful night
to see them, and it’s perfectly safe, there will be
lots of people along the road.”</p>

<p>Miss Comstock glanced swiftly down the
street, then reached out to pat her hand. “You
Yankee girls are so energetic,” she drawled.
“I’m sure Serena would much prefer to sit right
here and listen to the beautiful music.”</p>

<p>But it seemed Serena wouldn’t. She, too, was
on her feet. “We’ll just go a little way, Aunt
Anna,” she said, “and we won’t be gone long.
Come on, Yankee gal,” and she linked her arm
through Cynthia’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
She laughed and talked animatedly for the
next block or two but when they came out of
the new town and faced the walls of the ancient
fortress, all green and dark gold under the moon,
with crickets shrilling from the banks of the
little stream and the lights of the houses behind
them, she was silent again.</p>

<p>“Let’s not go any farther, here’s a splendid
place to sit,” suggested Cynthia, who thought
the other might be rather tired, and had found
a seat on the handrail of the little stone bridge.
One could hear far off music and voices sounding
faintly, and contrary to expectations the road
was almost deserted. Perhaps the old town had
little romance or mystery for those who had
always lived within sight of its walls. But she
must make conversation; this wasn’t being a
good guest.</p>

<p>“Where do you go after Carcassonne?” she
asked, politely, then saw, with astonishment
that Serena was crying!</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t do that!” cried Cynthia distressed.
“Look here, you aren’t happy. Can’t you tell
me about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh I hate France, I hate Europe, I hate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
town worst of all!” and Serena suddenly flopped
down beside Cynthia and dropped her head on
a much surprised Yankee shoulder. “I want to
go ho ... ome! I want ... to ... go
... ho ... ome!”</p>

<p>“Is it just homesickness?” asked Cynthia
gently. She certainly knew a lot about that
feeling since she came abroad, but Serena shook
her head, then started to wipe her eyes. “No
...” forlornly. “It’s ... it’s Jack.”</p>

<p>“Jack? Oh ... ah ... yes,” murmured Cynthia
vaguely. “Come, sit up and tell me all about
it,” and she patted the other’s back, reassuringly.
She had heard that it was sometimes easier to tell
your troubles to a stranger. Serena may have
heard that too, for she said:</p>

<p>“It’s Aunt Anna, really. She’s mother’s oldest
sister. Oh I know she doesn’t look it, but
she’s always had money and can afford to do
things to keep young and buy clothes to make
herself pretty and I guess that’s about all she
cares about anyway. I guess long ago she was
in love with Jack’s father, too, though that’s
only a sort of guess.”</p>

<p>“Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
“Jack Hemstead. He’s a boy from home,”
as though that were sufficient explanation. “And
when Jack ... Jack said he ca ... cared for me
...” she swallowed, waited a minute and went
on, “Aunt Anna made fun of him, and said it was
all foolishness at our age, though I’m eighteen
... and Jack’s nearly twenty one, and finally
she said she’d take me abroad for the summer
and then maybe I’d see Jack wasn’t so marvelous.
But he is, oh he’s the most marvelous person.”</p>

<p>She’d start to cry again if Cynthia wasn’t
careful. “But haven’t you written him?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Serena nodded vigorously. “Yes, but we had
a quarrel just before I left. He said if I really
cared I’d marry him then, even if we weren’t
of age. But I guess maybe I wanted the trip and
I thought I could have Jack too, and I haven’t
heard a word, not one single word since I left
home. I’ve written and written begging him to
write me and I’m so ashamed!”</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong somewhere,” thought
Cynthia, wondering what on earth she could do
about it. “Tell me more about him? And how
long have you been over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
“Only four weeks and Auntie’s really been
awfully kind, in her own way. She’s bought
me things and things, and we shopped for
clothes till I never want to see another Paris
label again. I hated Paris. Then Aunt decided
to come to Carcassonne. We are sailing from
the south of France. She said she’d once read a
poem about it. But you’re the first young person
I’ve talked to since we left home. On the
boat she was awfully sick and wanted to be read
to all the time, so I just stayed in the cabin with
her, I was so grateful for the trip. But I didn’t
know Jack wasn’t going to forgive me,” she
wailed.</p>

<p>Cynthia, looking off towards the walls
through the sweet scented moonlight, felt very
sorry for this little Southerner. But it all seemed
too remote, too far away for her to do anything
to help. With Jack in America she couldn’t
do anything more than lend a listening ear to
Serena and try to cheer her up as much as possible
in the few days they’d be staying here.</p>

<p>Serena seemed quite content with that, quite
willing, in the days that followed just to trail
along with a book or a bit of sewing and sit, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
too far off, while Cynthia sketched along the
walls of the old city. She proved indeed extremely
useful. Her fluent French was a prop
for Cynthia’s faltering accents and she had a delightful
knack with persuading the children to
pose. Cynthia made three excellent portraits,
any one of which would do for her monthly
cover, then felt free to give her time to sketching
the town itself.</p>

<p>But wherever they went Aunt Anna either
hovered in the background or knew exactly
where they would be from half hour to half
hour. It was like having a secret service man
always in the offing. Serena didn’t mind but
Cynthia said it gave her the creeps, always to
have Miss Comstock bobbing up like a cuckoo
out of a clock, and put up with it only for the
sake of the other girl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she heard more about this Jack
person. She heard about the color of his eyes
and of his hair, about his cleverness and about
his family and about his job, which was, at the
moment, junior clerk, very junior indeed, in a
big real estate office in New Orleans.</p>

<p>“He’s got the nicest smile ... you’d think he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
was cross, really, until he smiles and then it sort
of ... flashes across his face,” expatiated Serena.
They had been sitting for the past hour in the
tourney court, trying to reconstruct the ancient
Court of Beauty with its lists; the ground enclosed
for the contest, its seats for the great
ladies from which the Queen of Beauty was
chosen. “I wonder if they called her ‘Miss
Carcassonne,’ or ‘Miss France,’” murmured
Cynthia to herself.</p>

<p>All was quiet here. One could follow, on
the ancient walls, the reconstruction of centuries,
the lower bricks of Roman tile, small
and flat, the higher coarser stone of the tenth
century, then above that, still more careful work
of later years and finally the deliberately antiqued
and weathered rebuilding of the great
Viollet-le-Duc, without whose interest and
wealth this greatest relic of the middle ages
would not exist today. Birds wheeled in the sunlight
above them, but the shadow of the wall was
cool and the small herd of tourists, whose
voices sounded from the tower above them,
scarcely left a ripple on the peace of the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
“I love this place,” murmured Cynthia
splashing happily in rich blue shadow color, but
she frowned a little. Something Serena had said
a moment back had started her memory working.
She didn’t really want it to work, she
wanted to stay here and finish her sketch. “That
was it though ... ‘it sort of flashes across his
face!’”</p>

<p>“This place gives me the shivers,” Serena remarked
crossly. “I guess it’s because it’s so full
of romance and I ... I feel so empty of it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Cynthia jumped off the wall and
began to gather up her painting materials. She
had remembered what she wanted to remember,
it was just a chance, the wildest chance possible,
but she had to know for sure. “I’m going back
to the hotel,” she said. “You stay here, Serena
... but I’d like it if you could come along in a
couple of hours and have tea with me. French
tea is terrible of course but we can order citron
pressé. I may have something to show you too.”</p>

<p>“Just me, without Auntie?” asked Serena.</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded. “Try, for Pete’s sake to get
her into a shop for an hour or two, or tell her
it’s time she took the tour around the walls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
She might enjoy the guide, he was very handsome
once,” she added maliciously, “but do come
without her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. I’ve got to stay here and wait for
her anyway. She said she’d be along about two
o’clock and it’s only half past one.” And her
puzzled dark gaze followed Cynthia down the
steep steps to the court, across it, through the
high pointed arch of the gate, and long afterwards
as she appeared again on the dusty stretch
of sunlit road to the lower town.</p>

<p>Cynthia had suddenly remembered that boy
at the Hotel de l’Universe, and how flashing his
smile had been, that one time she had seen it. But
he hadn’t even appeared on the terrace for the
past two days, perhaps he had left Carcassonne
entirely, and almost certainly he had no least connection
with Serena’s Jack, but he had looked so
forlorn and somehow he had looked Southern
too. Cynthia’s ardent desire to be again a Little
Miss Fixit almost persuaded her she could tell
a Yankee from a Louisianian even before he had
said a single word.</p>

<p>She’d ask at the hotel for the young American
with the brown eyes, and if he were still registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
there she’d leave a note inviting him to
join her for tea this afternoon ... anyway it
might be rather fun, even if nothing came of it.</p>

<p>Serena was on time, and Cynthia suggested
that the Hotel de l’Universe looked more amusing
than the terrace of her own hotel.</p>

<p>“And I’d like to try a grenadine, it’s such a
pretty color,” she announced, once settled at
the green painted table. So they each had one
of the sickly pink syrups so beloved of the French
and sat sipping contentedly while they gazed out
across the low hedge of dusty box that separated
the terrace from the street. Then Cynthia,
who was watching her companion, saw her grab
the edge of the table and go almost white.</p>

<p>“I was right ... I was right!” thought Cynthia.
“Oh Golly!”</p>

<p>“<em>Cynthia!</em>” gasped the other wildly. “Who
... who’s that?”</p>

<p>A tall figure was lounging down the street,
coming swiftly towards them. Then he had
got Cynthia’s little note, and had come almost as
though he had guessed what it was about.</p>

<p>The next happened so suddenly that Cynthia
could scarcely untangle it all. A very flushed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
happily laughing Serena, different from any
Serena Cynthia had yet seen, standing in the
entrance to the street, then tearing wildly towards
the approaching boy. A meeting of the
two, no doubt about its being the right Jack ...
and the amused delighted proprietor beaming in
the doorway. After all this was Carcassonne,
and it was France, where else in the world
would one expect to find romance, if not here?</p>

<p>“But how did you guess, how did you guess?”
asked Serena, as, introductions properly over
they sat again at the little green table. Jack
had placed his straw hat and the Tauchniz book
he had been carrying on the next table, had
ordered a beer, but had made no move to consume
it for his attention was too occupied with Serena.</p>

<p>“Oh, we traveled together, once upon a
time,” began Cynthia but immediately saw that
neither of her listeners was giving her the slightest
attention. Wisest to slip away and stand
guard outside. “I’ll give you a half hour together,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mes enfants</i>,” she said firmly, “but if I
give an alarm, you’ve got to scoot! Better get
busy and make your plans. May I borrow this?”
and picking up the little Tauchnitz paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
covered volume, she nodded, and went out
through the dusty hedge.</p>

<p>All this was making her feel pretty blue, herself.
Chick, also, might have been here today,
with a bit of luck. But Chick was a very satisfying
person; he, at least wrote letters, and fat ones
too. She had had one this morning and while she
waited would be a good time to read it again, for
the third time.</p>

<p>That finished she found a seat beneath the
plane trees and turned to the book she had picked
up, a volume of Conrad’s sea stories with <em>Jack
Hemstead</em> sprawled in large, plain hand across
the cover. She gave the couple thirty-five minutes,
then fearing that Miss Comstock, who of
course knew where Serena had gone for the
afternoon, might happen along, Cynthia got up
and briskly returned to the terrace.</p>

<p>Serena’s head was close to Jack’s tumbled
locks, and Cynthia was amused to note that their
warming drinks stood in the glasses just at the
height they had been when she left them.</p>

<p>“Well children, what’s the plans?” she asked
pulling out her chair again.</p>

<p>“We’re going to be married.” Serena’s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
were like stars. “Jack was twenty one last
month and he came over on a cattle boat, wasn’t
that brave of him? He got a big commission,
big for a beginner that is, for selling a business
plot in the city, so he decided to trail us over here
and see what was wrong. He found out our
address from the hotel in Paris. I’ve got a first
class ticket home, and Jack has a third class, he
thinks we can trade them in for two second class.
My ticket’s my own because Mother paid for
that, not Aunt Anna.”</p>

<p>“The American consul at Marseilles can
marry us,” Jack told Cynthia. “I can’t tell you
how grateful we are for arranging this. Serena
hasn’t been getting any of my letters.”</p>

<p>“Your aunt?” Cynthia’s eyebrows were questioning
and Serena nodded and shrugged. “It’s
all right now, but we can’t give her another
chance to mess things up for us. Jack thinks we
had better get away on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapide</i> tonight. But
I don’t see how I can get away before tomorrow,
not without an awful fuss.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to,” said Jack firmly, already
playing the heavy husband. “This is one time
when you’ll have to put on some Yankee pep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Your aunt knows I’m here, or at least that I was
here for over a week.”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” gasped Serena, and even Cynthia
was astonished.</p>

<p>“Yes, she saw me one evening when I was
strolling about the streets here, that was, let’s
see, about five days ago.”</p>

<p>The night Serena talked to me on the bridge,
thought Cynthia ... that’s so, he passed the café
where the lights were so bright.</p>

<p>“So a couple of days later she hunted me up
at the hotel. She said she had no intention of my
seeing her niece and of making her unhappy all
over again, and that Serena’s not writing was
proof enough that she was through caring for
me. That sort of set me thinking, for how could
she be sure that Serena wasn’t really writing to
me unless she herself was doing something about
it.”</p>

<p>“But I did write Jack, two letters every
week,” protested the indignant Serena.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, honey child, but your <a name="aunt" id="aunt"></a><ins title="Original has 'Aunt'">aunt</ins> was
very careful that they didn’t get mailed, or that
you didn’t get mine either. So I let her come
down to the station to see me off. She was most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
gracious, having won her point. She saw me
buy a ticket for Marseilles and get on the express,
but she didn’t know that it stops again
about a half hour beyond here, and that I got
off there and returned by the next train. I’ve
been very careful ever since to keep out of sight
as much as possible, but I’d seen you two together
so when I got Miss Wanstead’s note
I suspected that she had arranged something.”</p>

<p>“Oh Jack, and I never guessed you were in
Carcassonne all this time.”</p>

<p>For a long moment then they forgot all about
Cynthia till in protest that young lady remarked.
“Hadn’t we better get on with those
plans of yours?”</p>

<p>So for fifteen more minutes plans were made,
rejected, and reaccepted, till Cynthia looking
up suddenly exclaimed, “And here comes your
aunt!”</p>

<p>Tripping gaily down the street on the arm of
the little blesse, parasol unfurled, eyes upcast
in characteristic admiring pose came Miss Comstock.</p>

<p>“Run, Jack!” gasped Serena. “She mustn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
see you ...” and there was a scramble for the
doorway, a hasty return for the straw hat, and
at the last minute Cynthia reached out to switch
the untasted beer to another table, as though a
departing customer had left it there. But it
was a close shave.</p>

<p>Aunt Anna was full of the sights she had seen,
the new bargains she had procured, of the delightful
little soldier who had showed her
around, but her eyes were keen and Cynthia
knew she did not miss that beer at the next table.
Then Cynthia did a clumsy thing, she dropped
the volume of Conrad. For just a moment it
lay, face upward on the floor, the sprawling
signature showing plainly across its cover. Cynthia
bent to grab it, hastily flapped it on top
her purse, she rose immediately to go, she couldn’t
risk the fact that Miss Comstock might have
glimpsed that name.</p>

<p>The next two hours were merely a matter of
waiting. Serena and her aunt usually dined at
eight, and Cynthia, cautiously strolling along
the street which commanded Serena’s bedroom
window watched for the agreed signal, a handkerchief;
pasted against the pane as though put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
there for drying. She waited five minutes more,
then slipped upstairs, repeating to herself the
story she would tell if any one tried to stop her.
But no one did.</p>

<p>Serena’s room-key hung, in trusting European
fashion on a high nail beside her door. Cynthia
took it down, glanced once again along the
corridor, thought she heard footsteps and hastily
turned the key. Inside.</p>

<p>Serena’s bag, already packed, had been slid
beneath her bed. Her traveling coat and hat,
her street shoes were with it. Cynthia grabbed
the lot and opened the door again. Then came
a moment of fright, for the maid, Agnés, stood
just outside in the corridor. But she was
wreathed in smiles, already primed by Serena
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enlévement</i>, the elopement, and her
ancient romantic heart was in the job. She
piloted Cynthia along the corridor and down
the servant’s stairway, then out through an alley
behind the garage, put her finger to her lips as
a vow of silence, then blew a kiss into the air as
a gesture of her best wishes for the bride and
groom. No word between them had been passed
during the whole four minutes of action. Cynthia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
giggling, was on her way. This was certainly
something to write home about.</p>

<p>The remainder worked like a charm, a charm
of ancient Carcassonne, where, even in the tenth
century young ladies must have fled with their
heart’s desire. At nine o’clock the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapide</i> for
Marseilles stopped for five minutes at the tiny
station. At nine minutes to nine Jack with his
suitcase, Cynthia with Serena’s belongings and
a bunch of flowers for the bride-to-be, watched
anxiously down the street. Then against the
sunset appeared Serena, breathless, with dusty
evening slippers, still in her dinner gown, but
happy and incoherent with excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh you treasures, both of you!” she cried.
“Have we tickets? ... Goodness, there’s the train
already ... She thinks I’m out buying some aspirin
tablets ... I didn’t have time to leave a
note on the pincushion ... My lamb, will you tell
her I’ve gone? ...” and rattled on and on while
they climbed into the compartment. Cynthia
kept one anxious eye on the door. She didn’t
know what would be the proper procedure
should Aunt Anna appear at the station with the
fire of suspicion in her eye. Cynthia had a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
momentary vision of herself grabbing the woman
around her ample waist and hanging on
until the train could have pulled out.</p>

<p>But no one appeared. The conductor blew
his little toy trumpet, shouted the usual warning,
and at the last minute Cynthia still clasping the
bridal bouquet had to run beside the carriage to
fling it through the window. She had a final
glimpse of Serena’s starry eyes, of Jack’s white
smile.</p>

<p>Then silence. Nothing.</p>

<p>Cynthia came out of the station door to the
deserted cobble street and twilight. “I wish
it had happened to me,” she thought a little
mournfully. “But maybe it will, soon,” and
had no idea how very soon that would be. The
moon hung like a burnished platter above the
romantic old town, too beautiful, too unreal to
be true.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Cynthia, going practical all
of a sudden, “I guess somebody’s got to break the
news to Auntie!” And started down the street
toward the hotel of Miss Comstock.</p>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Siena</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">THE RACING SNAIL</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> at Marseilles, where Cynthia had
planned to take train for Paris, for Cherbourg
and a ship for home, she caught up with her
mail. One specially fat and formidable envelope,
with many seals, for which she had to sign
papers and more papers, proved to contain, of
all things, the long deferred check for the capture
of Goncourt, the jewel thief.</p>

<p>Cynthia, in the office of Cook and Sons, stood
surveying the paper with bright round eyes. So
many francs&mdash;one thought in francs now, not in
dollars&mdash;would purchase&mdash;what? Presents for
home? Her luggage was already heavy with
’em. More clothes in Paris? She had, really,
all she needed. A trip to some place farther on?
Cynthia nibbled a pink finger tip and thought
about that. Maybe never again, after this once,
would she get to Europe. Maybe she’d be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
day, a long time off, one of those little old ladies
with shawls who sit in corners, well out of the
draft, and talk with wistful reminiscence of
“when I was in France&mdash;when I was in Italy.”
Meaning of course the <em>one</em> time they were there.
Perhaps that wouldn’t be true, perhaps she’d
come again in a year or two. But just the same
she owed it to herself to get all she could out
of this adventure while she was right here
on the spot. The thief had proved to be just so
many extra francs, dropped by the gods directly
into her lap. Shouldn’t she, therefore, take it
for a sign, cable home that she was waiting for a
later boat, and go on with the adventure?</p>

<p>“When I was in Italy,” the rhythm returned.
Cynthia whirled to face the surprised young
man behind the counter.</p>

<p>“If you had a windfall of ... so many hundred
or thousand francs,” she asked him, “where
would you go&mdash;from here?”</p>

<p>The young man grinned cheerfully and replied
in meticulous English. “Madmoiselle, I
should go to Italy.”</p>

<p>“Bon!” Cynthia was enchanted that his
advice should agree with her mental toss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
of a coin. “And where in Italy, please?”</p>

<p>The young man grinned more widely and
shuffled the papers on his counter. Here then
was a customer for the tickets he had to sell.
“Madmoiselle, I should go to the palio in Siena.
It is the month for that. Madmoiselle has heard
of the palio? Non? Oh, but then&mdash;&mdash;,” and
he proceeded to expound.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Cynthia, walking on
air, emerged from Cook and Sons. In her purse
reposed a ticket for Italy. And the palio in
Siena would be one of those things she could
talk of, once she got to the age of relating,
“When I was in Italy.”</p>

<p>Five days later Cynthia, in Siena, pressed
her small tip tilted nose flat against the glass of
the dusty window, peering in. She had come
again, for the third time today to see the frame.
The lovely leather frame was right in the foreground
propped against the glass, just as it had
been yesterday and probably for weeks and
weeks before that. Beside it lay other leather
things; cigarette cases, glove boxes and portfolios,
all beautiful. But it was the frame that
interested Cynthia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
It was the one frame in all Siena, which, after
all is a city of leather frames, for the photograph
of Chick which she had received in the mail in
Marseilles. And nothing short of perfection was
worthy of holding that picture. In it the face
of Chick squarely fronted the beholder, the hair
of Chick was fluffy and rumpled, as it had been
when the Academy bunch had given him his
nickname, the eyes looked straight and truly into
the eyes of Cynthia, and the quirky mouth
seemed just about to say: “Hi, Cynthia ...
Darling!”</p>

<p>The frame was wine colored, the leather as
soft as old satin, and all around its edge was a
delicate gold border of conventional ivy leaves,
with, next to it, a band of oak leaves and tiny
acorns, and inside, next to the glass a tiny frail
beading. All very simple but it was the color
and the workmanship that held Cynthia’s eye.</p>

<p>She sighed. She knew to a lira just exactly
what was in her purse, knew that she mustn’t
afford the frame, no matter how low the price
might be. Nevertheless she pushed open the
paint scarred old door in the stone housefront
and entered the little shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
It was, as she had expected, dim and dusty
within. The proprietor, an aged little Italian
with the down-drooping nose of one who works
in delicate detail, was busy with another customer.
She also, was an American, small and
dainty, expensively clad, older than she appeared.
Cynthia smiled to herself. After two
months in Europe she knew the type very well.</p>

<p>“Too much, too much!” she was saying, in
Italian over and over again, and gestured
prettily with a gloved hand toward a small pile
of cigarette cases lying on the counter. Unexpectedly
then she turned to Cynthia.</p>

<p>“You look as though you could speak Italian,
my dear. Do ask him if he will give me a better
price for the whole dozen. I want them for
bridge prizes, next winter.”</p>

<p>Cynthia was willing to try, and struggled
with her scant store of the language. The proprietor
shrugged his shoulders and spread expressive
Italian fingers wide. “Yes, yes, eight,
ten lira less perhaps,” he smiled. And Cynthia
knew that all along he had expected to take less
than his original price. But the pretty lady was
pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
“Wrap them up,” she ordered the man, in
the loud tone so often employed to the foreigner
who seems not to understand, as though by mere
volume of sound one could impress one’s meaning.</p>

<p>Cynthia had removed the lovely frame from
the window and now held it in her hand. Close
like this, it was even more beautiful than when
viewed through the wavering old glass, and at
Cynthia’s “How much?” the old man smiled
almost fondly, as though he too knew this for
one of his best pieces. He named the sum in lire
and Cynthia made a rapid calculation, then,
with a sigh, shook her head and turned to replace
it in the window. He might as well have
said fifteen hundred dollars, as fifteen. Why, in
her tiny room in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensione</i> she could live for
two whole weeks on fifteen dollars. Chick would
have to wait, unframed, till she returned to the
States and a steady job.</p>

<p>The American lady was still fussing over the
wrapping of her package when Cynthia left the
shop and stepped out into the street again, one
of those steep streets of Siena that seemed to bear
always in their sunny stone the tinge of a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
sunset glow. From far down the street
came the roll of a drum, and Cynthia who had
already seen two of these <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrade</i> rehearsals
pelted off as fast as rubber soles on cobbles could
carry her. Never mind the frame, though she
gave it a regretful relinquishing thought.</p>

<p>Tomorrow was the Palio, the famous horse
race with which Siena, twice a year, for the past
four hundred years, has celebrated her liberation
from the long arm of her tyrant neighbor,
Florence. And now for the past three days
Siena had fallen back, body and spirit, into the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Certainly Cynthia, rounding the corner of the
narrow street, felt as though she had been projected
feet first into a slice of the middle ages.
Banners of silk and of satin, of tapestry and of
heavy velvet, fringed and tasseled in gold, embroidered
with the arms of some ancient family,
hung from a high balcony, and above it, glowing
in the warm stone was carved again the heraldic
device. Below the slow swaying banners stood a
little band of Siennese, two drummerboys in
long-hose and doublets, peaked caps over their
frizzy locks, their companions two banner-bearers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
all in black and white and gold. The
flags displayed the arms of their <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i>, or
ward; this one Lupa, the Wolf, and their huge
ruffled sleeves and the little purses which
dangled from their belts were embroidered in
fine gold with a similar device.</p>

<p>The drums tapped out a strange, intriguing
little rhythm while the two banner bearers,
practising their rite, did a sort of solemn dance
with the great five foot square flags. The object
seemed to be to keep up a continual stepping,
with the banners never for one moment allowed
to lag. Under the arms and up again, out and
beneath the dancing feet, and the drums always
beating faster and faster. Fascinated, Cynthia
watched for the culmination which she knew
would come. With a final roll of the drums the
banners were flung high, high, almost ... incredibly,
to the tops of the houses, then descending,
their heavy sticks acting as weights, were
caught lightly and skillfully. And the dance,
for the moment, was over.</p>

<p>There was a slight cheer from the small
group that had gathered to watch and a voice
behind her said “Gosh, that was great!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
It was such a shock to hear, in this scene of the
past, a good American voice that Cynthia
whirled involuntarily to face the speaker. To
her surprise he was all of fifty, with the reddish
complexion of a confirmed golf player, a shock
of nice thick white hair, gray tweeds, the expensive
kind, and a panama hat which he wore
in his hand.</p>

<p>Cynthia met his smile with one as friendly.
“It is nice, isn’t it,” she said, for no particular
reason except that one so often does speak to
fellow Americans on foreign soil. Then she
started to turn away.</p>

<p>“They’re having a <em>prove</em>, in the Piazza del
Campo, this morning,” he informed her. “Perhaps
you’d like to see that too?”</p>

<p>“Oh are they? Thank you,” said Cynthia,
and this time she really did turn away. She had
already seen one of the <em>proves</em>, the rehearsal for
the big race, and thought she’d prefer, instead of
seeing this one, to find a place to sketch. With
her final cover off to America she was free now
to sketch wherever she pleased, and she had an
idea that she might work up material for an
exhibition, back in New York. The heads to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
her main attraction but perhaps a few landscapes
to add a little variety to the show.</p>

<p>That afternoon she saw the man again. She
had taken her sketch box and camp stool, and
having hired a tiny barouche, was set down
about two miles out of Siena where a little old
monastery sat atop a tall hill. Here among the
cypresses she could sketch for an hour, or two,
or three, nibble her apple and sandwiches, and
in the cool of later afternoon pack her box and
walk back to town.</p>

<p>Cynthia had chosen a shady angle of the wall,
and had roughed in her drawing; a bit of a gateway
tiled in warm red, and a tall niche where
stood a della robbia madonna robed in blue as
deep as the Italian sky. Bougainvillea spilled
in a fountain of magenta over the wall, and Cynthia
was struggling with this riot of color when
she heard the <em>clopity-clop</em> of <a name="horses" id="horses"></a><ins title="Original has 'horses'">horses’</ins> hoofs, but
did not look up. Color dried so swiftly in this
warm dry air, one had no time for distractions.</p>

<p>Then there were voices, two, a man’s and a
woman’s, the feminine voice light, pleasant,
but pitched to a note of amused complaint that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
was vaguely familiar. Cynthia could not help
overhearing.</p>

<p>“Why on earth you had to drag me way out
here, Gerald! Oh, of course the road was lovely,
but we have so little time in Siena and I did want
to get in some more shopping ...”</p>

<p>“Shopping! Always shopping! Don’t you
get enough shops in the States?” replied the
man’s voice in very husbandly tones.</p>

<p>“Now Gerald, you remember I didn’t really
want to come to Siena in the first place, but then
of course I had no idea the leather and the iron
work was so lovely here.”</p>

<p>Leather, that was it! The woman who had
bought the cigarette boxes this morning. And
the man with her? Cynthia, absent-mindedly
wiping her brush on her white skirt said a faint
“Darn!” for the color was rose madder and
probably would stain ... peered out from behind
her wall. The man was her nice gray haired acquaintance.
Well, his trip to the monastery
was no business of hers.</p>

<p>Now how to get that tone of sunlight between
the deep leaf-shadows? Ah, that did it! Intent
on the success of a trick of the trade, Cynthia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
forgot the voices and when she came out of
her corner an hour later there was no one, native
or American, in sight. Cynthia took the two
mile walk home through a lemon tinted sunset,
ran into another flag rehearsal just at the edge
of the town and enjoyed it hugely.</p>

<p>So pervasive and <a name="insistent" id="insistent"></a><ins title="Original has 'insistant'">insistent</ins> was the tap. tap ...
tr...r..r..r... tap. tap. of the drums that she
seemed, that night to dream about them all night
long and she woke the next morning with the
distant, dream patter of the rhythm still tapping
merrily through her head. In the pale light of
early morning the sound was so real she could
not banish it with the remainder of her doze and
finally hopped out of bed to see if she had been
hearing the reality.</p>

<p>Sure enough, just down the street the banner-dancers
were practicing their strange little steps,
and the first rays of sunlight over the housetops
caught the gilded tips of the banner staves as
they were flung, in the final flourish of the dance,
to the house tops. Cynthia remembered the fourteenth
of July celebration in Paris and grinned
to herself. She was prepared, now, for such
festive spirits. Besides that, and all reports to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the contrary notwithstanding, the Italians didn’t
seem to put so much noise into their celebrations
as their French neighbors. But then they let
off more steam in just every-day living.</p>

<p>When she had finished her brief and early
breakfast and emerged to the street she saw that
this was truly and whole-heartedly a gala
day.</p>

<p>The steep cobbled way to the cathedral which
crowned the hill was like an illustration clipped
from her Morte d’Arthur, a street made ready
for the entrance of a Lancelot or a King. Banners
of silk and banners of velvet, cloth of gold and
cloth of silver, all embroidered with the arms
of Siena and her ruling houses, and, so far as
Cynthia knew, of Mussolini himself, hung from
every upper window and balcony, fluttering in
the morning breeze with a constant play of color
and pageantry along the gay little street. Every
doorway held smiling faces above the garments
of this holiday mood. Every child carried a
<a name="brilliant" id="brilliant"></a><ins title="Original has 'brillant'">brilliant</ins> hued balloon or a whistle, or a small flag.
And down around the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">piazza</i> where the race was
to be run the side streets were crowded with tiny
bright colored booths, peddling those cheap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
sticky indigestibles that go with a holiday all the
world over.</p>

<p>Cynthia wanted very much to see the ceremony
of blessing the horses that were to run in
the race. Only ten of the seventeen wards might
compete, due to the tiny race course, and these
would be chosen by lot just before the race began.
Each horse would be in the little chapel
of its own <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i>, so Cynthia chose the Snail,
since that of all the ward names seemed to appeal
to her most. It was so delightfully silly for a
Snail to be running a race, even by proxy.</p>

<p>The chapel was a plain little building of
warm stone, hidden in the lower edges of the
walled town, and the room was already crowded
with interested and loyal Snailists, including
the horse, who seemed the most interested of all.</p>

<p>Cynthia listened with delight to the sonorous
Latin phrases of the little priest, but almost burst
into giggles at the horse’s astonished expression
when his nose was sprinkled with water from
a kind of overgrown silver pepper box. It was
an emotional relief when she caught a glance
from an amused gray eye, twinkling over the
heads of the shorter Sienese and automatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
she twinkled back at it. Then she saw a tuft of
stiff white hair and recognized her acquaintance
of the day before. Cynthia flushed and bit her
lip. When she looked again he was gone.</p>

<p>Behind the chapel was a room used for exhibition
purposes. Here in the dim glass cases, dusty
with age, were the ancient costumes worn in
past Palios by the jockeys of the Snail. Many
of them were hundreds of years old and all
displayed the same careful craftsmanship, the
same loving care for detail that Cynthia had
noted in the costumes she had seen on the streets.</p>

<p>She made some sketches in her notebook, and
went back to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pensione</i> by way of the leather
shop to have another look at the frame in the
window.</p>

<p>Back in her room she emptied her pocketbook
on the bed, and counted her express checks and
lire. But the frame was hopeless. She just
couldn’t manage it, not even if she asked the
shop keeper to come down in his price. The
price was fair, Cynthia felt that it was even
more than that, and one couldn’t ask a fellow
artist to cheapen his wares.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Chick darling,” she told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
photograph propped between the mirror and the
hair brush, “you’ll just have to go as you are.
Maybe a little later ...”</p>

<p>For the future looked very bright indeed.
Cynthia had already received two letters from
advertising firms who were interested in her
covers on <cite>Little One’s Magazine</cite>, and she had
an idea for a new series for that same publication,
once she was back in the States. But at the
moment, in a strange country, with no friend
nearer than Nancy and her Mother in Brittany,
Cynthia didn’t dare risk fifteen of her precious
dollars. Oh dear, it was difficult to be poor,
’specially when Chick needed a frame!</p>

<p>Where at she planted a cautious kiss on the
pictured countenance of Mr. Charles Dalton.</p>

<p>The Palio race was due to start at five that
afternoon. Cynthia took her sketch book and
her portfolio to use as a lap-rest and went off
early to find the seat she had purchased three
days before. She could spend the time in sketching
the crowd&mdash;you never could tell; some day
she might be called on to illustrate a story about
Siena and then her foresight and her sketches
would come in handy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
For days the workmen of Siena had been
preparing the Piazza del Campo for this event.
In the center was a walled off space known as
the Dog’s Box, where the poorer people might
stand. The race course itself came between
this and the tiers of seats raised against the housefronts
that faced the piazza; hard, narrow little
seats like the bleachers of a ball park. But
Cynthia was lucky, for she was on the shady side,
and was so interested that she didn’t much care
how long she sat there.</p>

<p>Her neighbors were mostly tourists, French,
Italians from the south, Germans, a few Austrians,
and one or two Americans. Small boys
sold bags of nuts, and programs in five languages
while the shadow of the bell tower slowly crept
across the Dog’s Box and the hard packed earth
of the race course. Cynthia noted the mattresses
strapped against the bare walls at the four
corners of the course, presumably that the horses
or riders might not be injured in the scramble
around these dangerous places, and learned from
her pink leafed program that many of the horses
did daily duty through Siena’s streets, pulled
cabs, or fruit carts during the year and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
owners each belonged to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i> from
which they were chosen to race.</p>

<p>At last the sound of a mortar. The crowd
which had been strolling leisurely about the
course began to squeeze in under the fence to
their places in the box, or scramble, goat-like up
the steep tiers of wooden seats. Urged on
by the carabinieri, those delightful, self-contained,
tweedledum and tweedledee police
of Italy, loiterers were soon cleared from the
course and way was made for a group of little
men, like blue clad gnomes. These, pushing
tiny wheelbarrows, swarmed along the roadway.
Their job seemed to be to cover with earth any
places where the original paving stones might
show through.</p>

<p>Then again the sound of the mortar. And
here they come!</p>

<p>First the Ensign Bearer of Siena, with the
simple black and white flag of the city. Then
the Palace Trumpets, the picturesque long
trumpets with their pendent banners carried by
youthful pages in jaunty velvet caps, slashed
doublet and sleekly silken hose. Then the musicians,
all in costume and the crossbowmen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
their ancient weapons and at last a group from
each <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i>. In each group a drummer, two
flag bearers, a Lord or Captain on horseback in
gorgeous armor, of silver, or bronze, or steel
beautifully inlaid with gold that glittered in
the sunlight. Behind him his squires, his ensign
bearers, and on the race horse, the jockey who
would ride later, in the race.</p>

<p>Slowly the procession passed around the
course. Before the <a name="judges" id="judges"></a><ins title="Original has 'judges'">judges’</ins> stand, and four times
as they circled the square each group paused that
the drummers might perform their little
rhythm, that the banner bearers might dance
their skillful little steps.</p>

<p>Cynthia sat enthralled. Almost she had to
pinch herself to believe it was real. Glorious in
color as an old window of stained glass; silks
and velvets, knights in full armor, pages, banners
and trumpeters, and at the very end the
Palio itself, a great banner drawn in a cart, with
the staked flags of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i> around it.</p>

<p>The procession was over. Cynthia sat back
and cracked a few nuts and ate them. Just to
return to reality for a while, after so much
beauty, was a rest and a relief. She had thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
so intensely, packed it down so tightly into her
memory that no least gesture of it might be
forgotten. Even so, she felt as though she
would have liked a week of that procession in
order to be able to remember it all.</p>

<p>Again the mortar.</p>

<p>The race was about to start. Ten restive little
horses ranged behind a rope, ten jockeys struggling
to keep them in line. The sound of the gun.
They’re off!</p>

<p>Panting, scrambling, hurled against the Dog’s
Box, cutting corners, they tore around the course,
and the piazza was one vast shout as though
from a single throat. Cynthia, on her feet like
the rest, stamped and clapped and shouted with
the others. The Snail, the little brown Snail was
among the leaders. Once around the course.
Three times was the extent of the race. And
the starting post was in sight again. But one
rider was off&mdash;which was it?</p>

<p>The Snail’s! Cynthia could have sobbed
aloud with despair, with disappointment. Her
favorite, out of the race because without a rider.
Someone had raised a whip and the Snail’s jockey
had been the victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Oh well, so much for that! Cynthia, disgusted,
almost sank back to her seat, but the mass
of excitement around her was too strong to resist.
The Snail, for some reason, seemed still to
be a favorite, his name rose again and again
from surrounding throats. Stubbornly he kept
to the track, came to the first of the tiny streets
that turned off, away from the race track. Gallantly
he resisted temptation, clung to the course.
Past the next alley, past the next street, and well
among the leaders still. Pulling ahead now,
faster and faster, because riderless, guideless.
The Snail caught up with the horse of the Eagle,
passed him, caught up with the horse of the Owl,
hitherto the leader. The Owl’s rider plied
whip with vigor, but he was a husky youth,
quite a burden for the Owl’s little horse to carry.
And the Snail was half a head in the lead as the
goal post was passed for the second time.</p>

<p>“Oh come on ... come <em>on!</em>” Regardless now
of the fact that the horse was riderless, Cynthia
wanted only that he should make the circle the
third time. Successfully.</p>

<p>Now he was well in the lead, past the wicked
flail of the Owl’s malicious rider. Nothing now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
could stop him, though as he approached for the
third time the steep street leading up into the
town Cynthia held her breath lest this time he
should leave the course and gallop up it. Held
her breath so that she was completely unconscious
of the broad shoulders in front of her
which her eager hands were grasping.</p>

<p>For an instant the pony faltered. Then
urged on by the pounding hoofs behind him
passed the last temptation. And was on the final
stretch for the goal post.</p>

<p>Faster. Faster! A length, two lengths,
three lengths ahead. Cynthia shouted wildly,
pounded a fist on the harris tweed shoulder and
yelled with the others. “Go on ... Snail ... go
on! ... Go on! ... Home! ... <em>Ah..h..h!</em>”</p>

<p>The race was over. “And quite fitting that it
should have been won by the Snail,” dryly remarked
the owner of the harris tweed shoulder.</p>

<p>Cynthia came out of her daze and gaped at
him. It was the nice twinkley man she had seen
in the chapel this morning, the one who had
come to the monastery with his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” she gasped, feeling very
hot and red in the face. “Did I pound you to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
jelly? Races are pretty exciting, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“They certainly are,” he agreed cheerfully.
“And that was a most surprising one.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he really won?” asked Cynthia,
carefully following the man down the steep
narrow steps. “I don’t imagine it will be allowed
like that, without a rider, will it?”</p>

<p>The man laughed. “Well, this is Italy, you
know, and after all they may figure it was a race
for horses, not jockeys. And the horse certainly
came in ahead. But let’s go and find out,” he
suggested. “By the way, my name is Lewis,
though I believe we have met before, even if
you didn’t know my name.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Lewis. I’m pleased to
meet you I’m sure,” stated Cynthia with mock
primness. “And now that’s over, we’re both
from the States, I gather, and my name is Wanstead.
Didn’t your wife come to the races?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis shook his head. “If it had been
Longchamps, or Saratoga ... But she wasn’t interested
in a little Italian hick town race. Oh,
here we are, and I imagine there’s little doubt
about the winner.”</p>

<p>The rose-and-gold Snail jockey, wreathed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
flowers and comically suggestive of an ancient
Greek statue, a blood stained handkerchief as
additional decoration about his forehead, was
being carried high on the shoulders of a dozen
competitors for the honor of the burden.
Around him surged a horde of shouting friends
and at least a score of pretty girls tossed jests and
languorous glances toward the victor.</p>

<p>“I think they ought to be carrying the horse
up there,” was Cynthia’s objection. “The
jockey didn’t do anything but tumble off.”</p>

<p>“That in itself seems to have been a feat not
without its perils. How about some tea up here,
to celebrate that our horse won?”</p>

<p>Over the tea cups, in the ancient palace now
transformed into a tea shop, over delicious tiny
cakes, sweet with honey, deep with frosting,
Cynthia heard about Mr. Lewis. Heard that
long ago he, too, had been an art student and
had come to Siena, heard that he had come back
this time, a successful broker, to try to recapture
some of the enchantment of that far off time.
“But it’s not the same,” he said sadly. “How
about some more tea?&mdash;No?&mdash;Then some more
cakes&mdash;oh, just one more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
“Well, maybe, just one.” Cynthia chose a
cake like a little Italian palace, all tiled with
lemon peel and crowned with a candied cherry.
“And do you know the lovely old monastery at
the top of the hill?”</p>

<p>“I should say I do. I made a sketch of that,
years ago&mdash;before you were born, young lady.”
Why did people always lay such emphasis on
one’s lack of age? “But my wife didn’t think
much of it, and perhaps it wasn’t very good,
really. Anyway it got lost once when we were
moving.”</p>

<p>His smile was slightly rueful and Cynthia
forgave the remark about her youthfulness.
“It was of the gate, and a lovely old Della
Robbia madonna. I went out to see it again, just
yesterday, but couldn’t find it.”</p>

<p>“Why, I found it, and did a sketch of it too,”
Cynthia blurted out, and a moment later wished
she hadn’t. It was obvious that he had been
dragged away before he had had time to do much
exploring.</p>

<p>“Did you? Oh, could I see it perhaps? But
first won’t you have another cake, some more
tea?” urged the hospitable Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
“I couldn’t eat another cake if I knew it was
the last one in Siena,” protested Cynthia. “And
I think I’ve got the sketch right here. The portfolio
made a good rest for my sketch book.”</p>

<p>So there in the tea shop, cool and quiet and
growing a bit dim as the sun sank behind the
towers and tiles of Siena, Cynthia hauled out
her sketches. There were some of the crowd
she had made just this afternoon, of the carabinari,
heads gravely bent, two by two, always
two by two, white gloved hands folded behind
their solemn backs.</p>

<p>“You have quite a knack for caricature,”
commented Mr. Lewis, and Cynthia <a name="said" id="said"></a><ins title="Original has 'said.'">said,</ins>
“You have to, if you are going to do portraits.
A really good likeness always holds a little exaggeration.”</p>

<p>At which he nodded understandingly. Nice
to be showing your sketches to another artist.</p>

<p>“And here are some of the landscapes I’ve
done around Siena, mostly bits of streets and old
tiled houses. They aren’t as good as my people.”</p>

<p>“And here is your madonna,” she cried, hauling
out the drawing she had finished the day
before. She told him about her plan to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
an exhibition of the heads and of the landscapes
together.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea too,” he agreed, and
propped the little sketch of the monastery
against a chair and sat back to squint at it.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said at last, “if you’d be willing
to make a sale before you go home. I have
a fancy to own this one,” and he nodded towards
the little tiled gateway. “Could you part with
it, do you think?”</p>

<p>Cynthia hesitated. She did sort of want to
show that one to Chick and hear his approval.
But perhaps tomorrow she could go back to the
same place and make another, even a better one.</p>

<p>“We..ll, yes,” she agreed reluctantly. “I
might.”</p>

<p>And then came the “How much?” which
she had dreaded. Cynthia knew the value, at
least the commercial value, of her portraits.
But the landscapes were different. They were
just studies, perhaps not worth anything at all.
“Would ... would two dollars be too much?” she
asked. “Or maybe three?”</p>

<p>“My dear child!” protested Mr. Lewis, and
Cynthia laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
“Well, give me what you like. It will be
all right anyway.<a name="dash" id="dash"></a><ins title="Original has space before dash">&mdash;Oh</ins>, American money,
how nice to see it again!” And it was quite a
roll, too.</p>

<p>She took the two bills and handed over the
painting. “Better take along this cardboard, it’s
just the back of the pad, but it fits, and will keep
the sketch from being crumpled. And now I
really must run. I promised a little English
girl at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pensione</i> that I’d have dinner with
her tonight and tell her all about the palio. She
couldn’t afford a ticket for it. I know she won’t
at all approve of the way it turned out. ‘Most
unsportin’ my deah!’” she laughed, mimicking
the other’s accent.</p>

<p>“Goodbye,” waved Cynthia from the doorway.
Nice Mr. Lewis. It had been fun, the tea,
and such an appreciative audience&mdash;and the two
dollars. She opened her purse, just for the comfort
of seeing good United States greenbacks
again, shook them out of the rumple and gazed
at them, startled. Not two one dollar bills, but
two for ten dollars each. Twenty good bucks!
Oh gosh ... oh glory ... oh joy!</p>

<p>“Miss British Isles can wait,” said Cynthia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
aloud to the deserted street and turned rapidly
in a direction opposite to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pensione</i>. She
knew somehow that her luck would hold, her
marvelous luck of the day, and that even as late
as this sunset hour, with the rosy housefronts of
Siena still holding their perpetual sunset glow,
the little man in the frame shop would still be
there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chick that night was no longer propped
limply, somewhat forlornly, between the dusty,
green tinged mirror and the box of cold cream,
but smiled gaily, resplendently, festively, in a
frame of wine colored leather with a border of
acorns and gold beading.</p>

<p>Cynthia bent over and bestowed a brief kiss
on the chilly glass.</p>

<p>“Hi, Chick ... Darling,” she laughed. And
turned off the light.</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="noi p180 mb2"><em>Venice</em></p>

<p class="noi p120 mt2">ALL IS NOT LOST</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> was sleepy when she stumbled into
the station at Genoa. She hadn’t been too sure
that the hotel keeper would wake her in time
to get the train for Venice. So all night long she
had dozed fitfully, waking to sit <a name="bolt" id="bolt"></a><ins title="Original has 'bold'">bolt</ins> upright and
flash on the light to see her watch, then finally
been waked from a sound sleep at five, just an
hour before train time by the sharp summoning
knuckles of the garçon on her bedroom door.</p>

<p>And it must have been because her eyes were
still blurred with sleep that she took the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rapide</i>
instead of the express for Venice. They were
standing directly opposite each other, and both
of them had “Venezia” in letters a foot high
along the carriages. An Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rapide</i> does not
necessarily move with great rapidity. By the
best of expresses it is a long day’s journey across
the width of Italy and by the time she had discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
with the half dozen native phrases that
she knew, that she had taken the wrong train it
was too late to do anything about it. They were
already an hour east of Genoa.</p>

<p>“What time do we get to Venezia,” she
begged. “Venezia ... <em>Venezia</em>. ...”</p>

<p>“Si...si...si...si...si,” hissed the beaming
conductor as he punched her ticket.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what time? Tempo? Tempo?”
she pleaded.</p>

<p>The conductor shook his head and shrugged.
Probably mad, this pretty signorina. But he had
no English, and what did she in third class, in
that expensive dress of real silk, with leather
shoes upon her feet, a hat, and a suitcase also of
veritable leather? He gave it up and sauntered
down the crowded aisle between the wooden
benches to examine the biglietto of a wizened
little great-grandmother traveling, with six
great-grandchildren, to Milan.</p>

<p>Cynthia grinned and settled philosophically
against the frame of the open window. Ten
hours was a pretty long time, and it would be
more than that now in this poky old train, but
anyway it was an adventure and all part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
traveling. She was certainly going in the right
direction, there was no one to meet her at the
other end, no one to worry when she didn’t arrive,
and she would have all day to observe and
to make sketches.</p>

<p>Third class had been almost a necessity, this
Italian trip hadn’t been allowed for in her
original budget, but Cynthia had found third
class in France so much more fun than second
... and of course even the Italians say that no
one but rich, rich Americans and officials who
travel on passes ever go by first. This was the
coolest carriage too, since the always open
windows let in floods of air and sunlight along
with the floods of dust, and the hard wooden
benches were pleasantly free of the small insect
life almost universally inhabiting the upholstery
of first and second coaches.</p>

<p>But third class in Italy! The young man at
Cooks who had sold her her ticket had almost
expired to hear of an Anglo-Saxon traveling in
so unorthodox a fashion. No one ... <em>no one</em> ever
traveled third class in Italy! Cynthia surveyed
the coach and chuckled again.</p>

<p>Further down the aisle, two lovely little Sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of Santa Chiara, in the soft, dove-gray habit
of their order, with spotless wide-spreading
winged headdresses and speckless collars
munched contentedly and daintily on bread and
cheese augmented by a bottle of water they had
brought with them. Cynthia’s eye took in the
angle of that tilted, sail-like headdress, stealthily
her fingers groped for sketch-book and pencil.
A moment later she was so absorbed in her drawing
that she absent-mindedly grinned back in
friendly fashion at the littlest Sister, who had
caught her drawing. Nobody seemed to mind
being sketched in this country.</p>

<p>Then there was the old great grandmother
and her boisterous brood. Beside them she
tended a hen in her apron, a hen that seemed
very content to sleep and to cluck drowsily in
the warm depths of that blue lap. The littlest
bambino was not more than a year old, sleeping
with bobbing head on the shoulder of the oldest
sister. He had the most beautiful hands, tapering,
with tiny dimples and wee pink nails, which
fell into enchanting poses. Cynthia sketched
happily.</p>

<p>People came and went from every tiny station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and crowds gathered and dispersed beneath the
trailing potted flowers that decorated the pillars
of every station platform. Cheerily they
screamed “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Buon giorno!</i>” “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio!</i>” “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Arrivederci!
Arrivederci!</i>” Italian, someone had told
Cynthia, was a language intended to be shouted.</p>

<p>The sun grew warmer, the paper beneath her
hand sticky with perspiration. Somewhere
along the line a few lire purchased a sandwich of
garlic-flavored sausage between thick slices of
warm bread, a bottle of warmish water and a
bunch of sweet, very juicy green grapes. After
lunch she curled in her corner and slept.</p>

<p>When she awoke the car was nearly empty
and they were clattering and banging through
the light of midafternoon. Hills were purple
beyond hot haze and vineyards, white with dust,
spread for miles and miles on either side the
track. Cynthia sighed and got up to walk the
length of the car and back again. Where were
they now, she wondered?</p>

<p>When they stopped with a clatter and bang
at the next station she hopped out to look at the
map hung on the station wall. Keeping one
careful eye on the train lest it slide out and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
her, she estimated the probable time that it
would reach Venice. Good gracious, it was
hours away yet! And at the rate this train was
going ...</p>

<p>The little horn tooted its warning and Cynthia
fled back to her seat. What to do, what to
do? Thank goodness, nobody would be at all
worried or put out by this fool mistake of hers.
Nancy, back in Brittany by now, and Mrs. Brewster
were the only people that knew about her
trains and her plans. Mother had insisted when
Cynthia first left America that she keep in touch,
close touch, with some one person in Europe, and
she had been awfully faithful about that. She
had even written Nancy what train she was
taking from Genoa ... and now, Cynthia
grinned ... look at the darn thing!</p>

<p>By five o’clock she was ravenous and very
weary. From former experience she knew that
she could hop off almost any place that the train
might stop and continue next day on the same
ticket. But for hours they had not passed a
decent sized town, just little settlements about
the usual tiny church and inn, a few donkeys and
a mangy yellow dog or two. Did she dare get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
off just anywhere and risk what she might find,
or should she stick on here till seeming doomsday,
till midnight anyway and arrive at some
weird hour on the unknown canals of Venice?</p>

<p>Fumbling in the pocket of her silk jacket she
found a single lira and on impulse flipped it into
the air. It dropped into her lap and she covered
it quickly with her hand.</p>

<p>“Heads; I’ll get off at the very next stop,
no matter if it’s in the middle of a field. Tails;
I’ll go on to Venice, no matter how late we get
there or how hungry I am,” she said aloud.</p>

<p>She uncovered the coin. Heads it was!</p>

<p>Cynthia was a little scared. But determined,
oh very determined. Resolutely she took down
her suitcase from the rack, swung her painting
box beside it. Firmly she waited by the open
window till the train banged again to a stop
beside a little shack that served as a station. The
sign read Santa Maria Something-or-other, a
name which meant nothing to Cynthia. Sturdily
she stepped backward down the three steep steps
to the ground, swung her box and suitcase off
beside her and turning her back on the poky
little train walked toward the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
“Tomorrow ... tomorrow morning I go to
Venice,” she explained to the gatekeeper who
was punching lacework patterns into her ticket.
“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Domani. Comprendo?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si, si.</i>” Wonderingly he let her pass. Not
until the gate had closed firmly did Cynthia feel
sure that she herself wouldn’t turn and race
toward the departing train, the train that eventually
must reach Venice.</p>

<p>When the last shriek of the whistle had died
along the echoing hills, when the last smudge
of smoke had disappeared against the dazzling
light of the sinking sun, Cynthia was plodding
almost ankle deep in dust along the wide path
that seemed to do duty as the town road. But
there was literally no town here. Far off across
the plowed fields a sugar white tower reared
against the skyline; the village church. Four or
five scattered houses with the inevitable grape
vine, their whitewashed sides stained verdigris
green with arsenic spray, and a tiny inn to
which the gateman had directed her. This
latter was her objective.</p>

<p>Its entrance was beneath a vine covered lattice
and its bare dirt floor, its collection of dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
looked much like the other farmhouses. But
inside there were several tables and a girl behind
a counter. She slid forward and smiled shyly
with a flutter of incredible lashes. Cynthia felt
reassured.</p>

<p>Stumblingly she asked for a room for the
night, explained her wish to be called early for
the first train for Venice.</p>

<p>Yes, signorina, there was a room, but one.
The signorina should regard it.</p>

<p>It was bare, save for the bed, table and chair
and directly above the café, but clean and cool.
Cynthia nodded, did not ask the price and letting
her suitcase slide to the floor, ordered water with
which to wash. That was easy, one always asked
for water. Supper also should be simple, since
a traveler was expected to desire food. Cynthia
thought of her first night in Paris and felt a
little proud of how much more confident she had
become since then. What would Chick think of
this adventure of hers, she wondered and was
glad he needn’t know about it for weeks yet.
He’d be sure to scold her for taking such a risk.</p>

<p>It proved however to be no risk at all. At
supper, a simple meal of spaghetti, a salad and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
grapes, she was examined shyly by several children,
hopefully by several dogs, curiously by
the adults of the family. But the spaghetti was
delicious and Cynthia was hungry. After dinner
she was far too sleepy to do more than take a
short walk down the quiet dusty road. Back in
her room she wedged a chair under the latch of
the lockless door and fell asleep almost before
she could think again what an adventure this
was.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The express from the north, to which Cynthia
transferred a half hour beyond the little
village, arrived in Venice about nine o’clock.
It looked, she thought as she waited in the train
corridor, just a little disappointing, only a long,
tunnel-like train shed. No canals, no gondolas,
no palaces in sight.</p>

<p>The burly Italian in front of her swung off
with his bags, Cynthia prepared to follow, and
stopped stock still, midway of the top step.</p>

<p>“<em>Chick!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Cynthia</em>,” came the excited reply, “Where
on earth? ...”</p>

<p>“I ... I thought you were in New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Chick!” And stood gaping with open mouth
until a large bag prodded her, not too gently, in
the middle of her back. Then she swung down
the steps and dropped suitcase and paint box to
fling herself into the arms of the surprised young
man. Almost, it seemed, as surprised as she was.</p>

<p>“I thought you were due last night, on the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rapide</i> from Genoa,” exclaimed the disgusted
Chick. “You wrote that to Nancy you know.
And I’ve been meeting trains almost all night. ...
It was only by luck I stopped here. I was
meeting the express from Genoa on track six
ten minutes ago.”</p>

<p>He signaled a porter. “This your stuff? All
of it?” A hand beneath her elbow, impersonally,
kindly, almost as though he were the
favorite nephew of a maiden aunt, all concern
for her baggage, that she pass the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dogana</i>, the
local custom house, that she give her ticket to
the proper uniformed official. They came out
of the stone doorway onto a half dozen steep
stone steps. Before them shimmered the canal.
So the popular report was true and Venice did
have them?</p>

<p>“I’ve got a gondola waiting right here ...” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
looked along the bobbing, yelling line of gondoliers
who shouted their wares and virtues below
the quay. “Dash that fellow ...” she heard
him mutter. “Oh well, never mind Cyn, we’ll
take this one,” and still with that air of a
nephew-who-expects-to-be-well-remembered-in-the-will,
piloted her down the step.</p>

<p>The wide upholstered seat was very comfortable.
With surprisingly little fuss they
were in the center of the stream, Chick had given
the order, his fingers caught hers and held them
tight. Good, then they really were still engaged!
Cynthia chuckled happily.</p>

<p>“I can’t ...” she turned to gaze at him ... “can’t
get over this Chick. It’s the greatest
surprise of my life.”</p>

<p>“That was the intention,” Chick grinned
back. He had, he told her, arrived in Naples
two days ago, had promptly wired Nancy to find
Cynthia’s exact address and had been told of
the train she would take to Venice.</p>

<p>“Neat, very neat!” approved Cynthia. “If I
just hadn’t taken a local by mistake. And now
where are you taking me?”</p>

<p>“Pensione Casa Petrarca?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
She nodded, Yes, that was where she had reserved
a room.</p>

<p>“Had your breakfast? Good. Then wash
and tidy up and we’ll do a bit of sightseeing.
After that. ...” Quietly he slipped his hand
from hers, slid it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, Chick, what’s the matter, what is
it?”</p>

<p>“I’ve ... that is I seem to have. ...” And
with the maddening masculine manner of one
blessed with many pockets started fumbling
through them all, one after another.</p>

<p>“Lost something?”</p>

<p>Chick frowned. “Gone. But I hope it’s
not lost.” Deliberately he went through the
whole lot again while the gondola rocked gently
before the steps of the pensione. At last he
shrugged. “I came out last night and this
morning with a gondolier named Luigi, from
the traghetta, that’s a sort of gondola taxi-stand,
across the way. If I’ve dropped the thing, it’ll
probably be in his gondola. Go on up, will you?
I’ll see if I can trace him.”</p>

<p>A big airy room with a quaint porcelain stove
in the corner. As the door closed behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
porter, Cynthia dropped into a chair and dragged
off her hat. She didn’t know whether to weep
or to laugh. Was she, or was she not, engaged
to Chick? He hadn’t mentioned it, he hadn’t
acted like it. She decided to laugh and felt
better. Washed her face, ran a comb through
her curls and felt better yet.</p>

<p>A bit of powder, some rouge and she was
ready to meet the world again, or at least Venice
and Chick. He was waiting for her by the
pensione steps.</p>

<p>“Know any Italian?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not much, I’m afraid, Chick.” But, she
thought, probably more than he did.</p>

<p>“Well, come see if you can make anything
out of this jumble of talk. I’m about cuckoo.
We’ll walk across, it’s a good chance to see the
Rialto bridge.”</p>

<p>This was of stone, lined with a shallow,
stepped, series of shops on either side, going up,
going down till one reached the farther side of
the Grand canal. Here Chick pointed out the
row of gondolas as the taxi-rank from which he
had taken Luigi.</p>

<p>Cynthia stammered a few questions, listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
to the voluble replies and managed to make out
that Luigi had gone some where with a sightseeing
party, probably to one of the islands.
He’d be back later in the day.</p>

<p>“This morning?” asked Chick anxiously.</p>

<p>“I guess so.” Cynthia was slightly careless
about that. Funny of Chick, not like him to
make such a fuss over some silly little souvenir
he’d bought. “Come on,” she put a hand on his
arm, “let’s go sight-see for a while.”</p>

<p>Somewhat reluctantly Chick agreed. Over
tiny crooked stone bridges they went, along
quays along whose mossy sides the water lapped
dark and mysterious, down blind, colorful alleys
where small children stuck their heads from
windows and yelled shrilly. “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non passaggio</i>
... no passage!” Cynthia adored it all, adored
being with Chick again.</p>

<p>If he only wouldn’t fuss so, she thought. For
he kept looking at his watch, glancing back over
his shoulder, until finally she gave it up in despair.
No use of sightseeing till Chick recovered
his lost property.</p>

<p>“How about going back now and having another
try at your gondolier?” she suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
He was so grateful that she was almost
ashamed of her impatience, and they turned back
immediately. But there was no further news;
Luigi had not returned. Desperately Chick
started to ask questions, perhaps one of the other
gondoliers had heard Luigi speak of a package
he had found?</p>

<p>Cynthia, first on one foot and then on the
other, for she was getting a little tired, translated
to the best of her ability. Chick stuck in a word
now and then.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Perdita.</i> ... Lost ... lost.” Was Chick’s
gender wrong, or had he really mislaid a blonde?</p>

<p>But a few in the group of gondoliers got the
idea. Apparently each one had, at one time or
another discovered something <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">perdita</i>. From
beneath the flea-infested blanket of a gondola
was produced a dogs-eared magazine. Cynthia
beginning to be amused read the lurid title in
flaming vermilion sprawled across its cover.
“True Tales of the Wild West.” The date was
over a year ago but it had been, undoubtedly,
once lost.</p>

<p>Other gondoliers left their bobbing craft,
passers-by drew closer as Chick’s eagerness held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
promise of rich reward. Waving the magazine
aside he chanted impatiently, “Piccolo ...
piccolo,” while he made gestures of small
measurement with his hands. Then aside to
Cynthia, “that does mean ‘little,’ doesn’t it?
Not a musical instrument?”</p>

<p>Cynthia nodded silently, not daring to risk
speech and watched with dancing eyes while
Chick refused, from a second cheerful brigand
a musty, torn golash.</p>

<p>Cheerful brigand number two was a sheer loss
to high pressure salesmanship. Cynthia caught
the word “<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Impermeabile</i> ... waterproof,” as
he covered the tear with one big hand. Twisting
the rubber inside out he sought to display its
amazing suppleness and elasticity while an admiring
group applauded both at the golash and
the salesman, with ohs and ahs of astonishment.
Cynthia was wondering how a single torn rubber
had been brought from so many thousand miles
to lie forgotten in a Venetian gondola, and also
how the gondolier thought Chick, with a foot
obviously many sizes larger, was going to use it.
But perhaps he surmised a sentimental attachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
She glanced at Chick. Poor darling, this
was awfully important to him, and it was mean
of her to take it all so lightly. But he was being
pretty darn solemn and masculine. Impatiently
she said. “If you’d <em>only</em> tell me what it is,
Chick, perhaps I could make them understand.”
Oh dear, how annoying men could be!</p>

<p>Chick seemed not to hear. The new distraction
was a cabbage, wilted, but unquestionably
of more recent vintage than either the galosh or
the ancient magazine. Its discoverer had
waited for a time outside the magic circle, while
firing forth a rapid stream of “<em>Ecco ... ecco
... ecco!</em>” as he held aloft the proffered
vegetable. Breaking through at last he encountered
the two previous presenters of articles,
thus gaining the attention also of the crowd.
Which was his downfall.</p>

<p>An old woman, black shawl over her head,
flattened slippers of magenta felt upon her feet,
having heaved her way through by sheer force
of language, not only wanted a cabbage, but <em>the</em>
cabbage. Perhaps it was the cabbage of her
childhood, perhaps she had nursed it from a tiny
seedling, this dejected thing. For a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
longer Cynthia listened, then screwed up her
face and clapped frantic hands to ears. Couldn’t
they get out of this soon?</p>

<p>Close behind the old woman came shouldering
two calm carabinieri, just in time it seemed
to prevent a general combat. White gloved
hands behind them, patent leather hats set
squarely above unruffled brows, two identical,
magnificent examples of the Venetian police.
Tweedledum, it seemed, asked the questions.
Tweedledee answered them. Conversely Dum
asked and Dee answered. Comparative silence
settled upon the circle and Cynthia cautiously
removed her hands from her ears.</p>

<p>All available witnesses began to present their
evidence. As there were perhaps a score in
number all acting out their theories in violent
pantomime, Cynthia began to wish they weren’t
right in the center of it. The one who had taken
upon himself the part of the inquirer after lost
articles, Chick’s rôle in fact, was losing things
in all directions with wide, dramatic sweeps of
his arms.</p>

<p>Tweedledum and Tweedledee executed a half
turn in perfect unison, raised right hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
gloves of immaculate whiteness in formal salutation
and in Chick’s direction. By now, Cynthia
knew them of old, they would have come to
an unshakable conclusion. If they awarded
the galosh to the old lady, the cabbage to Chick,
both parties would have to be content. But no,
they had another plan.</p>

<p>The cabbage was bestowed upon its rightful
owner who still lingered, voluminous with
words, to see what else might happen. The golash
returned to the gondolier in whose craft it
had originally been found. Cynthia applauded
the decision, then translated for Chick’s benefit
Tweedledum’s speech:</p>

<p>“We’re to go to the police station, Chick.
That’ll teach you, young man, not to start riots.
And I hope it does!”</p>

<p>Behind them an admiring and still unsilenced
throng applauded their departure, even followed
a short distance along the quay and over
the ancient bridge.</p>

<p>“My heavens!” fumed Chick, “can’t they
understand! I’ve said ‘perdita,’ and ‘piccolo’
till I’m black in the face.” But Cynthia was enjoying
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
“If you’d tell them a little more,” she
soothed, slipping her hand into his arm. “Or
if you’d even tell me. ... What in the name
of Agatha <em>have</em> you lost, anyway?”</p>

<p>The police were speaking again. Cynthia
thought she caught the word. ... “Fondere.”
Did that mean “found?” The Lost and Found
Department perhaps? She made that suggestion
to Chick.</p>

<p>A few more streets, a bridge or two, a narrow
sun-lit way and one of the innumerable palaces
which seemed now to be a police station, with
the crown and arms of Italy above the door.
Beyond this a damp and cheerless room, none
too clean and the equivalent of a desk sergeant
who drew towards him a large book and set down
their names, Chick’s and Cynthia’s, and their
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pensione</i>. Dum and Dee were doing all the explaining
but in Italian far too rapid for Cynthia
to follow. It might yet prove that she and Chick
had defied municipal authority by starting a
barter shop on the quayside, one decaying golash
for a wilted cabbage.</p>

<p>Tweedledum and Tweedledee had finished,
the man at the desk made a gesture. An attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
opened a door, flung back a huge iron grill
that closed off about half the room behind it and
signed for them to enter. Cynthia clutched at
Chick’s arm. Oh dear!</p>

<p>Frankly uncertain she followed Chick’s slow
steps, the attendant close behind, Dum and Dee
bringing up in the rear. Then the attendant
switched on a light, a series of lights disclosing
what might have been a wine cellar. But instead
of wine ... Cynthia choked back her
laughter and pointed.</p>

<p>A bicycle, a shelf of gloves, a regular store of
ancient umbrellas and sunshades, piles and piles
of books, mostly Baedeckers by their moldy red
bindings, boots, odd bits of clothing, a coffeepot,
market loads still knotted in capacious handkerchiefs,
a coffin, a load of bricks. ...</p>

<p>Chick’s face was flaming. “How in the name
of goodness can we tell whether it’s here or not!”
He turned to Cynthia. “Don’t they have a list
of things somewhere, and the times they were
found? Tell them it’s small, small. And done
up in white paper and a box.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Cynthia nodded solemnly. “A
pound of butter, Chick dear. Oh Chick, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
weren’t going to ask me to set up housekeeping
were you?” But at the hurt expression in his
eyes her levity dimmed. “I’ll tell them you lost
it last night, is that it?” And turning to Dum
and Dee, carefully choosing her words, she managed
to convey the idea.</p>

<p>One of them gave a shrug of disappointment
which was echoed by the other. With all these
things to choose from, they seemed to say, surely
any but the most captious would be satisfied.
But they turned to discuss the matter with the
attendant. Lights began to go out, indication
that this particular exhibition was over, Finish.
But apparently more was to follow. Chick
might yet discover his pound of butter.</p>

<p>As they returned to the main room the attendant
departed and polite gestures demanded that
Chick and Cynthia should take chairs and wait.
An air of expectancy hung above the little room.
Obviously the choicest gem of the collection,
something too valuable to be left with the other
articles had been sent for.</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ve sent to the bank?”
asked Cynthia.</p>

<p>Chick brightened at the suggestion, brightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
until the door swung open again. There
entered behind the attendant a woman, slatternly,
down at heels, very cross and carrying a
basket on her arm. Slowly, reluctantly she advanced
to the desk, lifted the cover of the basket.
At the summons of the sergeant Chick appeared
beside her. With a wild burst Dum and Dee
grabbed the basket from the woman, thrust it
into Chick’s reluctant arms. Whereat the basket,
considerably disturbed, let out a long neck, green
mottled with brown feathers, a wide open yellow
beak, an indignant eye and a stiffly upstanding
comb of violent red. Loudly the occupant of the
basket protested with a violent “... C ck ...
a ... doo ... dle ... do!”</p>

<p>Chick nearly dropped the basket.</p>

<p>Cynthia, nearly helpless with laughter, had
fallen into a chair and, with face buried in her
handkerchief, could only indulge in what Dum
and Dee must surely have considered tears of uncontrolled
joy at this return of her lost property.
Sympathetic murmurs, croonings of consolation
echoed about the room. Even the rather hard
faced woman was touched. Chick stood stupidly
staring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
The hardest part of the day came when Cynthia,
drying her streaming eyes, was forced into
sufficient sobriety and Italian to explain that indeed
and indeed the rooster, and it was a beautiful
rooster, oh a magnificent rooster, was not
theirs. Was not at all what they sought.</p>

<p>“No, no, no, no, no!” Like a popgun, Cynthia
shot out violent negatives. And at last she
had made it clear. Almost with joy the woman
received back the cherished rooster from Chick’s
relieved embrace. Almost haughtily they were
shown to the door, sent, with an air of extreme
disapproval, upon their way.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunlight Cynthia was almost
surprised to find it was the same day, and Chick
pulled down his coat, let out a great puff of a
sigh.</p>

<p>After that first burst of laughter Cynthia
had managed to get control of herself, but she
wasn’t sure how long this would last. She must
get somewhere, anywhere, and have it all out
with Chick. Meekly she took his arm, let him
lead her along the quay, through small streets
toward the Piazza San Marco. She glanced
upward. Chick was being very masculine, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
stern, one might almost think, unforgiving.</p>

<p>In silence they traversed the small streets.
Well, if Chick was going to be stuffy! ...
But he couldn’t be, he simply couldn’t be. And
whose beastly old bundle was it anyway? <em>She</em>
didn’t go about leaving things in gondolas.</p>

<p>Florio’s, on the Piazza San Marco. A small
green iron table, two small twisted iron chairs
and an attentive waiter in a white apron. Chick’s
eyes consulted Cynthia, then ordered two lemonades.
They came. In silence Cynthia sipped
hers, bit her lips, gulped and regarded fixedly a
stupid, pink toed pigeon who was strutting, with
puffed out chest before the lovely little faun
colored lady of his choice. Sideways out of
her eyes Cynthia caught a glimpse of Chick,
then turned to face him.</p>

<p>His face was red but in his eyes was now a
glimmer of understanding, one might almost say
mirth. Cynthia dared a slight, tremulous giggle,
forerunner of the gale to come. Then. ...</p>

<p>“Oh Chick, Chick, if you could have seen
yourself with that silly rooster. ... And the
cabbage ... and Tweedledum ...!”</p>

<p>The tide had risen now, all bars were down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Rocking with mirth they clung to the little iron
chairs and laughed and laughed. A moment’s
pause to recount the pomposity of the attendant,
the old woman with the cabbage, the galosh, the
list of things in that storeroom. Did you see
the bicycle? ... Who could have left those
high, buttoned shoes? ... Oh, and the fans,
simply stacks of them!</p>

<p>For ten minutes the gale raged backwards and
forwards then, weak and helpless Cynthia
begged for another lemonade, wiped the tears
from her eyes and subsided into comparative
sanity. Their laughter together had relieved
her in many ways. It was going to be all right
now, she and Chick still thought alike, could
still find amusement in the same things, and
the doubts of the morning were all swept away.</p>

<p>“But Chick,” doggedly she returned to the
old question. “Now it’s all over, you can tell
me, can’t you? What was in that package?”</p>

<p>Chick wasn’t going to be stuffy about it any
more. He grinned this time, but shook his
head. “If we don’t find it today I’ll really tell
you. Not yet, though.”</p>

<p>“Cross your heart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
“Cross my heart!”</p>

<p>From the corner of the square a big bell began
a slow solemn booming and as though it was
a signal, hundreds, thousands of pigeons rose
against the deep blue of the Venetian sky and
the sunlit columns opposite. Glinting silvery,
<a name="iridescent" id="iridescent"></a><ins title="Original has 'irridescent'">iridescent</ins>, dark blue and rose and gold they
whirled with the muffled beat and roar of a
thousand wings. Cynthia gazed enthralled.</p>

<p>Across the square, giving access to the Merceria,
the Way of the Merchants, was the clock
tower. As the great painted face recorded noon
two giant moors slowly struck a bronze bell with
big hammers, marking the hour.</p>

<p>“Lovely!” murmured Cynthia. “Oh Chick,
I wish ... I wish we didn’t have to go back,
ever. I wish we could stay on, in one of those
sweet old palaces. ...”</p>

<p>“Like Othello and Desdemona?”</p>

<p>“No ...,” slowly. “She got smothered,
didn’t she? I guess I wouldn’t care for that.”</p>

<p>“New York will be fun too,” hazarded Chick.
“And with all the advertisement you’ve had,
young lady; your magazine covers on every
newstand, month after month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
“Chick! Are they really? Yes, I suppose
they are, I hadn’t thought of that. Better hurry
back, hadn’t I?” And then laughed at her own
weather-vane mood. “Well, what shall we do
next, Chick? I feel sane once more.”</p>

<p>Chick’s suggestion was: lunch at the Danieli,
which was the swankiest hotel in Venice, and,
he had heard, one of the loveliest of the old
Venetian palaces. Then back to the traghetti to
see if Luigi had come.</p>

<p>Oh, that again! Cynthia made an impatient
gesture. Save us from a man with one idea!
But she adored the lunch, loved the gracious
old palace with its carved, minstrel gallery, its
floor of multicolored tiles, its ceiling carved
and painted in deep blue and rose and gold. Out
into the sunlight again, and the Adriatic shimmering
as blue as the ceiling, a pleasant little
wind chilled by the snows of the Dalmatian
Alps and the white bubble of the Church of the
Salute rising across the lagoon.</p>

<p>“Shall we ride, or walk?” asked Chick. By
the way he said it Cynthia knew he wanted to
walk.</p>

<p>“We see more on foot, don’t we?” she suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
amiably. Perhaps a little later they could
go through the Grand Canal in a gondola. And
indeed she loved the great Piazza flanked by the
Doges Palace, by St. Mark’s and the long colonnade
of the Library and the Mint. And the shops
beneath those columns most fascinating of all.
Cynthia’s whole allowance for abroad had been
divided between seeing places, and saving up a
bit for what might, when she got home, prove
to be a long wait for more work. But she had
learned a lot by looking just in windows, had
learned that you can so memorize a beautiful
thing you can at least carry it away with you in
your mind.</p>

<p>“See, Chick, isn’t that the loveliest old bracelet? ...”
A thick circle, not quite joined, of
gold, the two ends which almost touched circled
with tiny crowns of blue, blue turquoises. “And
oh, Chick, just look at that ring. ...” A lovely
old thing of Florentine gold, studded with seed
pearls and surrounding a topaz as richly dark
as the gold itself. Chick put a hand on her arm
and urged her along to the next window which,
being full of ancient books and maps was not
quite so enthralling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Perhaps it hadn’t been really tactful to admire
that ring, almost as though she had wanted
it herself. She had Chick’s own ring, hadn’t
she? The little emerald, very prettily set, not
quite good enough, not quite old enough to be
called an antique, not quite the same as though it
had been bought just for her. ... Cynthia
checked the feeling. It was unkind, ungracious,
ungrateful. Chick was just a poster artist in the
first year of his success, he had come all the way
to Venice just to see her, or at least she supposed
he had, for he hadn’t said so yet. ...</p>

<p>And thank goodness, here was the traghetti.
Perhaps they’d find that stupid lost bundle of
Chick’s at last.</p>

<p>Word must have been passed around for there
was someone, Chick exclaimed that it was Luigi,
waiting for them, his weathered old face a mass
of interweaving laughter wrinkles. Sturdy,
stocky, clad in ragged clean shirt, with the uniform
black trousers and sash of the public gondolier,
Luigi dashed up the short flight of steps,
rushed toward them. In his outstretched hand
he held a parcel, small, oh very small. Not big
enough even for a quarter of a pound of butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
It had been opened, clumsily retied with gray
twine. Thrusting it into Chick’s hand he followed
with a flood of rapid Italian. Once more
a circle of interested onlookers threatened to engulf
them.</p>

<p>Chick gave a hasty order, grasped Cynthia’s
arm and thrust her down the steps, into the
Luigi gondola. Then waved a wide gesture
down the Grand Canal toward the lagoon
beyond.</p>

<p>“Buono! ... Buono!” agreed Luigi, nodding
vigorously like a porcelain <a name="mandarin" id="mandarin"></a><ins title="Original has 'manderin'">mandarin</ins>.
There came a faint cheer from the crowd on the
quay and Cynthia recognized a few of their
morning’s spectators. But the man with the
galosh, the woman with the cabbage were not
present. From the comfortable cushioned seat
she watched palaces of kings and doges,
princesses, great composers and poets glide past.
This was heavenly, this was the way to see
Venice, to see any place, with Chick’s hand in
hers and not a care in the world.</p>

<p>Then she saw the little package in his other
hand, glanced up inquiringly and caught the
look in his eyes. Her heart skipped a beat, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
beats. No nephew ever looked like that at a
maiden aunt!</p>

<p>“Let’s,” said Chick, taking his hand out of
hers, “let’s both undo the package. You do want
to see what’s in it, don’t you, Cyn?”</p>

<p>Cynthia laughed. “Here I’ve been hustled
and bustled over half of Venice, in jail and out
again ...” she addressed the diminishing
houses of candy pink, baby blue, as the gondola
struck the wide lagoon and rocked slowly away
from the town, “and he asks me, do I want to
know what’s in it. Man alive, do you think I’ve
got no curiosity?”</p>

<p>From behind them came a musical shout.
Luigi warning off another gondola. Beyond
him, Venice glowed pearl pink in the late light
of afternoon, the long paddle made a soft ripple
on the blue lagoon. Dark Italian eyes looked
over their shoulders, whole heartedly, honestly
as curious as Cynthia, and two heads, one brown,
one blond bent close together.</p>

<p>Cynthia untied the knot, with slim fingers
that were cold and loosened the rumpled white
paper. A small box of blue stained leather beautifully
tooled in gilt. She lifted the lid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
“Oh Chick ... oh you darling! Chick, is it
really, really for me?”</p>

<p>On the third finger of her right hand she
slipped it. Quaint old green gold, delicately
lacy as the collar of a doge, held firmly in its
heart a single pink pearl. Chick reached and
took the hand in his, slipped off the ring, slid
into his palm the little emerald she had worn
all summer, and in its place substituted the
other. It fitted as though it had been made for
her. Perhaps it was.</p>

<p>“Just for you, yourself,” he said. “It’s quite
old, four or five hundred years they told me. I
got it yesterday afternoon in one of those shops
you looked at, Cynthia. And I’ve been frantic
all day. ... I wanted to tell you, just this
way, in a gondola, with just this ring. And I
couldn’t, darling, tell you before.”</p>

<p>“Chick, it’s the most beautiful, beautiful
thing I ever saw in my whole life.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” said Chick, but when she glanced
up his eyes were not on the ring. “Tomorrow,”
he said, “we’ll see the American consul. I understand
he’s the marrying guy about here.”</p>

<p>Behind them suddenly came a great shout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
baritone, Italian. “<em>Yum tum tumti tumtum. ...
Yum tiddilty tum, tum ti tumitytum</em>. ...”
Confidentially Luigi leaned forward, whispered
in tones that might have been heard back in
Venice. “That, ladiee, gentleman ... that
ver’ fine Venezia loove song. You like?”</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
